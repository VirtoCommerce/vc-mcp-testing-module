# Business Logic Invariants — Agent Reference

Testable business rules for the Virto Commerce B2B e-commerce platform. Use this file to judge correctness when specs are ambiguous, absent, or when cross-domain interactions create emergent behavior.

## How to Use This File

- Each invariant has an ID (`BL-DOMAIN-NNN`), a severity tag, a declarative **Rule**, a **Verify** instruction, and a **Violation signal**.
- When a test result is ambiguous, check this file before classifying as PASS or AMBIGUOUS.
- When writing test cases, each business invariant should map to at least one test case assertion.
- Cross-domain invariants (`BL-CROSS-*`) are the highest-value rules — they catch the bugs that single-domain testing misses.
- If observed behavior violates an invariant here, classify as **FAIL** regardless of whether a JIRA spec explicitly covers it.

### Severity Tags

| Tag | Meaning | Test Priority |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| `[P0-revenue]` | Directly impacts revenue, orders, or payments | Must pass before any deployment |
| `[P0-security]` | Security boundary (auth, authz, privilege escalation, data leakage) | Must pass before any deployment |
| `[P1-data]` | Data integrity, state correctness | Must pass before sprint release |
| `[P1-ux]` | UX rule with stakeholder or legal weight (e.g., golden-rule UI sequence, WCAG-overlapping) | Must pass before sprint release |
| `[P2-ux]` | User experience, display, non-blocking | Should pass; acceptable to defer with ticket |

## Domain 1: Pricing & Discounts (BL-PRICE)

### BL-PRICE-001: Discount stacking order `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Discounts apply in order: (1) catalog sale price replaces list price, (2) tier/volume price applies at quantity threshold, (3) coupon/promo code applies to the already-discounted amount — never to the original list price.
- **Verify:** `cart.items[].placedPrice` reflects the stacked discount. Coupon savings are calculated on the post-tier price, not the list price.
- **Violation signal:** Cart total higher than expected; coupon discount amount equals percentage of list price instead of sale/tier price.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (UI totals), qa-backend-expert (xAPI `cart` query response)
- **Source:** vc-module-marketing `BestRewardPromotionPolicy.cs` — coupon/promo reward evaluated against the already-computed `CartTotal` (post catalog/tier price), not the list price.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-PRICE-002: Tax calculation position `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Tax is always calculated AFTER all discounts are applied. Tax base = (line total after discounts), not the pre-discount subtotal. Tax rate depends on the shipping address (destination-based).
- **Verify:** In cart/checkout, compare: `taxTotal` should equal `taxRate × (subtotal - totalDiscount)`, not `taxRate × subtotal`.
- **Violation signal:** Tax amount is higher than expected (calculated on pre-discount price), or tax changes when discount is applied/removed but the math doesn't align.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout totals), qa-backend-expert (order API)
- **Source:** vc-module-order `OrderTotalsCalculationTest.cs` + vc-module-cart `CartTotalsCalculationTests.cs` — tax computed on the post-discount total.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-PRICE-003: Price rounding `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** All monetary amounts round half-up to 2 decimal places in the display currency. Intermediate calculations may use higher precision, but all customer-visible prices (line totals, subtotal, tax, grand total) display exactly 2 decimals.
- **Verify:** No prices display with 0, 1, or 3+ decimal places. Check edge cases: items at $X.X95 should round to $X.X0 (half-up).
- **Violation signal:** Price displays like "$12.5" or "$12.456", or rounding inconsistency between line total and cart subtotal.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (UI display), ui-ux-expert (price formatting)

### BL-PRICE-004: Tiered/volume pricing boundaries `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a product has tiered pricing (e.g., 1-9 units = $10, 10+ units = $8), the lower price activates at exactly the threshold quantity. All units in the line use the same tier price (not split pricing).
- **Verify:** Add 9 units → price = $10/unit. Add 1 more (qty=10) → price drops to $8/unit for ALL 10 units. Line total = $80, not $90+$8.
- **Violation signal:** "From $X" label on listing doesn't match lowest tier; adding 1 unit at threshold doesn't change all units; split pricing applied.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (PDP price, cart), qa-backend-expert (pricing API)
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart `CartAggregate.SetLineItemTierPrice` — tier price selected once per add and applied uniformly to the whole line (no split-pricing branch).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-PRICE-005: Currency-specific price lists `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Each currency has its own price list. Switching currency activates the corresponding price list — prices are NOT converted by exchange rate. If no price list exists for the selected currency, the product shows as unavailable.
- **Verify:** Switch currency → prices change to values from that currency's price list (not mathematically converted). Products without prices in the new currency disappear or show "Unavailable".
- **Violation signal:** Prices appear to be exchange-rate conversions of the default currency; products without currency-specific prices still show a price.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (currency switcher), qa-backend-expert (price list API)

### BL-PRICE-006: Price list deletion behavior `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Deleting a price list in Admin removes all price entries it contained. Products that relied solely on that price list become unpurchasable on the storefront. No prices should fall back to $0 — they should show as "Unavailable" or hide the "Add to Cart" button. Already-placed orders retain their historical prices.
- **Verify:** Delete a price list → storefront products show "Unavailable" (not $0) → existing orders in Admin still display original prices → re-creating a price list with same products restores storefront availability.
- **Violation signal:** Product shows $0.00 after price list deletion; "Add to Cart" remains enabled; historical order prices change retroactively.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (pricing API, Admin), qa-frontend-expert (storefront display)

### BL-PRICE-007: Organization-specific (contract) pricing `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When an organization has a dedicated price list assigned, its members see contract prices that override the store default. Contract pricing takes precedence over catalog sale prices but is still subject to tier pricing within the contract list. Users not in the organization never see contract prices.
- **Verify:** Sign in as Org A member → product shows contract price (e.g., $7) instead of store default ($10). Sign in as non-org user → same product shows $10. Org A member adds to cart → cart uses $7.
- **Violation signal:** Non-org user sees contract prices; org member sees store default instead of contract; cart uses wrong price list after org switch.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (price display), qa-backend-expert (price list priority API)

### BL-PRICE-008: No floating-point money arithmetic `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** All monetary calculations must use decimal or integer-cent arithmetic internally. Floating-point rounding errors must never accumulate across line items — the sum of rounded line totals must equal the displayed subtotal. A discrepancy of even $0.01 between `sum(lineTotals)` and `cartSubtotal` is a bug.
- **Verify:** Add 3+ items with prices like $19.99, $7.33, $0.10 → manually sum line totals → compare against displayed subtotal. Check multi-quantity lines: qty × unit price = line total exactly.
- **Violation signal:** Subtotal differs from manual sum of line totals by $0.01+; penny discrepancy grows with more items; line total ≠ qty × unit price.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (cart math), qa-backend-expert (xAPI cart response)

### BL-PRICE-009: `discountPercent` is a 4-decimal fraction, rounded away-from-zero, independent of the money rounding policy `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** The `discountPercent` field (backing model `ProductPrice.DiscountPercent`, exposed via GraphQL `PriceType.discountPercent`) is computed as `discountAmount / listPrice`, rounded to exactly **4 decimal places** using **away-from-zero** midpoint rounding — hardcoded, and NOT routed through the pluggable money-rounding-policy extension point (that policy governs currency `MoneyType` amounts only, not this raw decimal fraction). When `listPrice` is zero, the value is `0`. The field is a **fraction** (e.g. `0.1250`), never a whole-number percentage, and is never `null`.
- **Verify:** Query a product's `price { discountPercent }` where a discount is active. Compute `round(discountAmount / listPrice, 4, AwayFromZero)` independently and assert equality. Confirm the value carries up to 4 decimal digits rather than being pre-multiplied by 100 or truncated to fewer decimals. A product with no discount returns `0`, not `null`.
- **Violation signal:** `discountPercent` returned as a whole number instead of a fraction; precision truncated below 4 decimals; a midpoint value rounded to-even instead of away-from-zero; `null` on a no-discount product; or the value changing after a custom money-rounding policy is registered (it must not — this field bypasses that policy entirely).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Docs:** N/A — implementation-detail; no VirtoOZ guide narrates this field's precision or rounding mode (§1a).
- **Source:** vc-module-x-api `src/VirtoCommerce.Xapi.Core/Models/ProductPrice.cs` — `private const int _discountPercentDecimalDigits = 4;` and `GetDiscountPercent() => ListPrice.Amount > 0 ? Math.Round(DiscountAmount.Amount / ListPrice.Amount, 4, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) : 0`; wired 1:1 in vc-module-x-catalog `src/VirtoCommerce.XCatalog.Core/Schemas/PriceType.cs` (`Field(d => d.DiscountPercent, nullable: false)`).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs N/A per §1a; Source + Live agree. Note: the shipped implementation deliberately does NOT reuse `IMoneyRoundingPolicy` — a review comment established that cash-rounding intervals would corrupt a percentage ratio.)

## Domain 2: Cart (BL-CART)

### BL-CART-001: Max quantity enforcement `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Per-product max quantity is enforced by available stock (or configured min/max). There is no automatic silent cap to available stock on either surface — but the two entry surfaces differ in where the enforcement lands, because the platform backend never refuses to persist an out-of-range quantity; it always accepts the requested value and attaches an advisory per-line validation error. **On the Product Detail Page quantity control** (a product not yet in the cart, or its own stepper), the storefront enforces the limit client-side before any mutation commits: entering a quantity outside the allowed range disables the Increase control, replaces it with an inline range affordance (e.g. "Order from X to Y item(s)"), and no line is added — the cart item count is unchanged. **On an existing cart-line quantity input** (the cart page), the storefront submits whatever quantity is entered via the quantity-change mutation, and the backend persists it as entered — the line's quantity, line total, and cart subtotal/tax/total all reflect the out-of-range value — while attaching a per-line validation message (e.g. "You can order maximum N item(s)") that the storefront renders inline and that keeps "Place order" disabled until the quantity is corrected. This out-of-range state survives a full page reload (it is server-persisted, not merely an optimistic client artifact).
- **Verify:** PDP: for a product not yet in cart, enter a quantity above available stock → assert the inline range message, Increase disabled, and cart item count unchanged (no line committed). Cart page: for an existing line, enter a quantity above available stock into the line's quantity input and submit → assert the persisted quantity equals the entered value (not capped), line total = qty × unit price, cart subtotal reflects it, an inline validation message renders, and "Place order" stays disabled; reload the page → assert the same out-of-range quantity, total, and message persist.
- **Violation signal:** On either surface, the quantity is silently capped to available stock with no error/message; OR the out-of-range quantity is accepted with no validation signal and "Place order" becomes enabled; OR the PDP path lets an over-limit line commit; OR an order is placed for more units than in inventory.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (PDP stepper + cart-line UI), qa-backend-expert (`addItem`/`changeCartItemQuantity` mutation response, per-line validation)
- **Docs:** N/A — implementation-detail (quantity-reject-vs-auto-cap UX mechanics; VirtoOZ guides do not narrate this, per §1a).
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart `CartLineItemValidator.ValidateMinMaxQuantity` → `CartErrorDescriber.ProductMinMaxQuantityError`/`ProductMaxQuantityError`/`ProductQtyChangedError` (FluentValidation `AddFailure` — attaches a per-line validation error but does not block the mutation). `AddCartItemCommandHandler.Handle` and `ChangeCartItemQuantityCommandHandler.Handle` (`src/VirtoCommerce.XCart.Data/Commands/`) both call `cartAggregate.AddItemAsync`/`ChangeItemQuantityAsync` with the requested quantity and save **unconditionally**, with no branch on the validator's outcome — the backend never refuses to persist an out-of-range quantity on either mutation. vc-frontend `locales/en.json` `validation_error.PRODUCT_MAX_QTY`/`PRODUCT_MIN_MAX_QTY`/`PRODUCT_QTY_CHANGED` (rendered inline via the error translator).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-27 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-27; DRIFT — corrected: the backend does not reject/refuse persistence on either surface; distinguished the PDP client-side pre-commit block from the cart-line accept-persist-flag-and-block-completion behavior, independently reconfirmed live including across a page reload; source + live agree, both fresh this run; docs N/A per §1a). Supersedes the 2026-07-22 amendment, which attributed a backend "reject" behavior to `CartLineItemValidator`/`CartErrorDescriber.ProductQtyChangedError` — that source anchor is real but only emits an advisory validation error; it does not block a mutation from persisting.

### BL-CART-002: Out-of-stock mid-session `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** If a product's stock reaches 0 after the user has added it to cart but before checkout completes, the system must prevent the order from being placed. The cart should show an error state for the affected item.
- **Verify:** Add item (stock=2) → in another session/admin, reduce stock to 0 → attempt checkout → error message, order NOT created. Cart should flag the item.
- **Violation signal:** Order placed successfully for an out-of-stock item; no error shown at checkout; oversold inventory.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout flow), qa-testing-expert (multi-session scenario)

### BL-CART-003: Coupon + sale interaction `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** A percentage coupon applies to the already-discounted (sale) price, not the original list price. A fixed-amount coupon subtracts from the cart total after all line-level discounts. If a coupon's minimum order amount is not met after sale discounts, the coupon must be rejected. Only one coupon per cart unless multi-coupon is explicitly enabled.
- **Verify:** Item at $100 list, $80 sale → apply 10% coupon → discount = $8 (10% of $80), not $10. Apply second coupon → rejected with "Only one coupon allowed" message.
- **Violation signal:** Coupon discount calculated on list price; coupon accepted when min-order threshold not met; multiple coupons applied when multi-coupon is disabled.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (cart totals), qa-backend-expert (promotion engine API)
- **Known behavior (2026-03-13):** Under `BestRewardPromotionPolicy`, applying a coupon-backed `CartSubtotalReward` **always replaces** an auto-applied cart subtotal reward, even if the coupon discount is smaller. This is by design in `BestRewardPromotionPolicy.cs:79-80` — coupon-backed rewards are explicitly preferred via `FirstOrDefault(x => !x.Coupon.IsNullOrEmpty()) ?? FirstOrDefault()`. Under `CombineStackablePromotionPolicy`, only one `CartSubtotalReward` per priority group is kept. Stacking two cart subtotal discounts requires different priority values. Neither policy is a bug — it's a store configuration choice. See `SBTM-promotions-2026-03-13.md` for full source code analysis.

### BL-CART-004: Currency switching recalculates primary-currency lines `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When the user switches the cart currency, every line item **denominated in the previous cart currency** must recalculate using the new currency's price list. If such a product has no price in the new currency, that line item must be flagged or removed. Shipping and tax recalculate. **Mixed Cart exception (Loyalty mode "Mixed Cart"):** line items denominated in a non-primary currency (e.g. a PTS loyalty line) are NOT converted — they are preserved at their original currency, so a cart MAY legitimately hold multiple currencies simultaneously. See BL-LOY-006 for the switch contract and BL-LOY-003 for the per-currency totals split.
- **Verify:** Single-currency cart: add items → switch currency → all prices, subtotal, shipping, tax use the new currency; products without a new-currency price are flagged/removed. Mixed cart: with a PTS loyalty line present, switch the base currency USD→EUR → USD lines convert to EUR, the PTS line stays PTS, item count unchanged.
- **Violation signal:** A previous-currency line still uses the old price; subtotal/shipping not recalculated; **OR** (Mixed Cart) a non-primary-currency loyalty line is wrongly converted, dropped, or duplicated on currency switch.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (cart UI), qa-backend-expert (xAPI cart recalculation)
- **Amended:** 2026-06-09 (Mixed Cart — VCST-5101). Previously asserted "no mixed-currency state"; superseded by the Mixed Cart model — see Domain 17 (BL-LOY).

### BL-CART-005: Cart isolation per organization `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** In B2B mode, each organization has its own cart. When a user switches organizations, the previous org's cart is preserved server-side but not visible. The active cart reflects only the current organization's items, prices, and shipping context. Cart items from Org A must never appear in Org B's cart.
- **Verify:** As Org A, add items → switch to Org B → cart is empty (or Org B's separate cart). Switch back to Org A → original items restored. Check xAPI: `cart` query with different org context returns different carts.
- **Violation signal:** Items from Org A visible in Org B's cart; switching back loses Org A's cart; xAPI returns same cart regardless of org context.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (org switcher + cart), qa-backend-expert (xAPI context)

### BL-CART-006: Pack size enforcement `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When a product has a minimum order quantity (MOQ) or pack size (e.g., sold in packs of 6), the cart must enforce that quantity is a multiple of the pack size. The quantity stepper should increment by pack size, and manual entry of non-multiple quantities must be rejected or rounded up.
- **Verify:** Product with pack size 6 → add to cart → qty = 6. Try to change qty to 7 → rejected or auto-rounded to 12. Stepper increments: 6 → 12 → 18.
- **Violation signal:** Quantity 7 accepted for a pack-size-6 product; stepper increments by 1 instead of pack size; order placed with non-multiple quantity.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (cart stepper), qa-backend-expert (addToCart validation)
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart `CartLineItemValidator.IsPackSizeLimit` → `PackSizeLimitSpecification` → `CartErrorDescriber.ProductPackSizeError` (reject path, not silent round-up).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-CART-007: Same product adds quantity, not duplicate line `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Adding the same SKU to the cart a second time increments the existing line item's quantity — it does not create a duplicate line. This applies regardless of whether the add came from PDP, quick-add, or xAPI. Exception: different product configurations (variants) create separate lines.
- **Verify:** Add Product A (qty 1) → go back to listing → add Product A again → cart shows 1 line with qty 2, not 2 lines with qty 1.
- **Violation signal:** Duplicate line items for the same SKU; quantity not incremented on re-add; line count increases on every add.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (cart UI), qa-backend-expert (addToCart mutation)
- **Docs:** N/A — implementation-detail (merge-vs-duplicate mechanics; VirtoOZ guides do not narrate this, per §1a).
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart `CartAggregate.InnerAddLineItemAsync` / `FindExistingLineItemBeforeAdd` — merges by incrementing the existing non-configured line's quantity; configured/variant items bypass the merge lookup entirely (`IsConfigured ? null : ...`), always creating a new line.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; CONFIRMED — Source anchor added, Rule unchanged. Live: same SKU added from PDP then from a listing produced one line at qty 2.)

### BL-CART-008: Cart persistence across sign-out / sign-in `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A registered user's cart is persisted server-side. If the user signs out and signs back in, the cart must be restored with the same items and quantities. If the user had items as a guest (anonymous cart), upon sign-in those items should merge into the registered user's existing cart (merge strategy: add quantities, no duplicates). A coupon applied before the merge (on either side) persists through the merge — it is not silently dropped — and its discount **re-prices against the post-merge subtotal** rather than staying frozen at the pre-merge discount amount, because a merge always runs a full cart recalculation before saving.
- **Verify:** Add items → sign out → sign in → cart restored. Separately: browse as guest, add items → sign in (existing account with different cart items) → carts merge without duplicates. Coupon case: apply a coupon to one side of the merge → sign in to trigger the merge → assert the coupon is still applied ("Remove coupon" shown, not silently cleared) and the discount amount reflects the merged (larger) subtotal, not the pre-merge amount.
- **Violation signal:** Cart empty after sign-in; guest cart items lost on authentication; duplicate lines after merge; quantities not combined; a previously-applied coupon disappears after merge; OR a surviving coupon's discount stays frozen at its pre-merge value instead of re-evaluating against the merged subtotal.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (sign-in flow), qa-backend-expert (cart merge API)
- **Docs:** N/A — implementation-detail (merge/re-pricing sequencing; VirtoOZ guides do not narrate this, per §1a).
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart `MergeCartCommandHandler.Handle` (`src/VirtoCommerce.XCart.Data/Commands/`) calls `cartAggr.MergeWithCartAsync(secondCart)` then unconditionally `CartRepository.SaveAsync(cartAggr)`; `CartAggregateRepository.SaveAsync` always calls `await cartAggregate.RecalculateAsync()` before persisting — so every merge forces a full recalculation pass (including promotion/coupon re-evaluation) rather than carrying over a frozen discount amount.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-27 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-27; MISSING → added the coupon-persistence-and-re-pricing clause to an existing entry; live-observed this run — coupon survived a guest-cart merge and its discount recalculated against the larger post-merge subtotal; source confirms merge always recalculates before save; docs N/A per §1a).

### BL-CART-009: Storefront cart enforces a single active coupon slot `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The storefront cart "Discount & coupons" section applies at most ONE coupon at a time across BOTH facets — the preset promotion cards (up to 4, authenticated + marketing-experience module only) and the single "Custom code" input. The applied-coupon slot is shared: exactly one card/input is ever in the "applied" state (button "Remove coupon"), never two simultaneously. Two transition paths exist: (a) clicking "Apply" on a DIFFERENT preset card auto-replaces the current coupon — `applyCoupon(new)` first awaits `removeCoupon(current)`, then `validateCoupon(new)`, then `addCoupon(new)`, in that order; (b) the custom-code input becomes read-only **only when its own bound value equals the currently-applied coupon's code** — i.e. when the applied coupon was entered through that input itself, or the applied coupon is not among the up-to-4 visible preset cards (the input then mirrors the code and locks). When the applied coupon IS one of the visible preset cards, the custom input is reset to empty and stays fully editable: a user can type and submit a different code through it without first clicking "Remove coupon" on the preset card, and the single-slot guarantee still holds because that submission goes through the same `applyCoupon` replacement logic. NOTE: this single-slot guarantee is enforced by the storefront UI only — the platform cart (`CartAggregate.AddCouponAsync`) appends coupons (case-insensitive dedupe) and does not auto-replace, so a non-UI/API caller can hold multiple coupons.
- **Verify:** Apply coupon A → exactly one card/input shows "applied"/"Remove coupon"; `cart.coupons[]` contains one successfully-applied entry (code A). Apply a different preset B → network shows `removeCoupon`(A) 200 → `validateCoupon`(B) → `addCoupon`(B) 200, in order; final applied slot = B only; discount reflects only B's reward (assert against the `AddCoupon` response `discountTotal`, not a computed %, per BL-CHK-006). Via the custom input: if A was applied through a VISIBLE preset card, the custom input resets to empty and remains editable (typing accepted, Apply button enables) — by design, not a violation; if A was applied through the custom input itself, or A is not among the visible presets, the custom input mirrors A and is read-only, offering only "Remove coupon". Anonymous carts render only the custom-code input (no preset cards; `promotionCoupons` not queried).
- **Violation signal:** two cards/inputs simultaneously in the applied state via the storefront UI; a preset "Apply" that adds B without first removing A (cart briefly/permanently holds 2 coupons through the UI); the PRESET card's own input (unconditionally read-only by binding) becoming editable — a binding regression; the custom input showing a stale/mismatched code, or failing to reset to empty+editable once the applied coupon is one of the visible presets; a replacement coupon's discount stacking on top of the prior one. (Separately tracked, not this invariant: an INVALID replacement code silently dropping the prior valid coupon because remove precedes validate — see VCST-5518 / `BUG-invalid-coupon-removes-valid-coupon`; a fix is in flight on `VirtoCommerce/vc-frontend#2422`, not yet merged to `dev` — see the open build-skew item in `reports/ba/bl-proposals-2026-08-05.md`.)
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (coupon section UI state), qa-backend-expert (mutation sequencing & cart coupon state)
- **Docs:** N/A — implementation-detail (coupon-slot UX mechanics; VirtoOZ guides do not narrate the apply/remove sequencing or read-only-input behavior).
- **Source:** vc-frontend `useCoupon.ts` (`applyCoupon` → on `dev` HEAD: `removeCartCoupon`→`validateCartCoupon`→`addCartCoupon` — see the open skew note in Amended), `coupons-section.vue` (`watchEffect` mirrors the applied coupon into `customCode` only when it is absent from the visible `promotionCoupons(first:4)` list, else resets `customCode` to `""`), `coupon-card.vue` (`:readonly="!custom || view === 'applied' || loading"` — preset cards unconditionally read-only; the custom card read-only only when its own bound code equals the applied one); vc-module-x-cart `CartAggregate.AddCouponAsync` (appends, case-insensitive dedupe — no auto-replace).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05. Claim A [single active slot] CONFIRMED, docs N/A per §1a. Claim C [custom-input read-only] **DRIFT — corrected**: the blanket "read-only once a coupon is applied" was stale; the real binding is conditional, evidenced by source (`coupon-card.vue` / `coupons-section.vue`) + live (typed into the custom input while a preset-applied coupon was active — text accepted, Apply enabled; the preset card's own input separately confirmed read-only by a real-user edit attempt the driver itself rejected as non-editable). Both axes are unaffected by the in-flight PR below, which touches only `useCoupon.ts`. Claim B [replacement call order] is CONTRADICTORY/build-skew and deliberately held OUT of this edit — `dev` HEAD still orders remove→validate→add, while the build under test runs the open, unmerged `VirtoCommerce/vc-frontend#2422` prerelease, which reorders to validate→remove→add and is itself the VCST-5518 fix. Re-audit trigger: when that PR merges to `dev` — staged in `reports/ba/bl-proposals-2026-08-05.md`.)
- Previously amended: 2026-07-22 (BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22 — reconciled both coupon-UI facets under one single-slot rule; superseded the "Radio-button coupon transition" framing; corrected the batch-1 "no preceding remove" claim).

### BL-CART-010: Configuration-item selection reprices the parent configurable lineItem `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When `selectedForCheckout` is flipped on a `ConfigurationItem` belonging to a configurable lineItem, the parent lineItem's `listPrice` MUST be recalculated immediately as the sum of all placements whose `selectedForCheckout = true`. The updated `listPrice` propagates into cart subtotal, taxes, and shipping via `SaveAsync → RecalculateAsync`. Deselecting a config item reduces `listPrice`; reselecting restores it. **Asymmetry:** lineItem-level selection (`changeCartItemSelected` family) does NOT change `lineItem.listPrice` — only configuration-item selection does.
- **Verify:** Obtain cart with configurable lineItem, all sections selected; record `lineItem.listPrice` as `price_all_selected`. Call `changeCartConfigurationItemSelected` to deselect one section → assert `lineItem.listPrice < price_all_selected`. Assert `cart.subTotal.amount` decreases by the same delta and `cart.taxTotal.amount` recalculates proportionally. Call `changeCartItemSelected` (lineItem-level) on an unrelated simple lineItem → assert its own `listPrice` is unchanged (asymmetry verification).
- **Violation signal:** `lineItem.listPrice` remains equal to `price_all_selected` after deselecting a placement; cart subtotal does not change; tax total does not update; pricing frozen at pre-toggle value.

### BL-CART-011: Unmatched section key in batch selection is a silent no-op `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When `selectCartConfigurationItems` or `unSelectCartConfigurationItems` receives a `configurationSections[]` list where one or more keys do not match any `ConfigurationItem` on the target lineItem, those unmatched keys MUST be silently skipped. The mutation MUST still process all matched keys, MUST return HTTP 200, and MUST return `errors[]` as empty. Unmatched keys leave no trace in the response.
- **Verify:** Obtain a configurable lineItem with 2 known section keys (A and B). Call `selectCartConfigurationItems` with `configurationSections: [keyA, {sectionId: 'does-not-exist', type: 'Product'}]`. Assert HTTP 200 and `errors[]` is empty. Assert `configurationItems[keyA].selectedForCheckout = true` (matched item flipped). Assert no error entry or warning appears for the unmatched key.
- **Violation signal:** HTTP 4xx or `errors[]` non-empty due to unmatched section key; entire batch aborted and no items flipped.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (xAPI batch mutations)
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart PR #114 §Validation errors; `CartAggregateTests` "unmatched section no-op" unit test.

### BL-CART-012: Configuration-item selection mutations are scoped to one `lineItemId`; "all" never crosses lineItem boundaries `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** All five configuration-item selection mutations (`changeCartConfigurationItemSelected`, `selectCartConfigurationItems`, `unSelectCartConfigurationItems`, `selectAllCartConfigurationItems`, `unSelectAllCartConfigurationItems`) accept exactly one `lineItemId`. The "all" variants operate only on configuration items belonging to that specified lineItem. No mutation may flip `selectedForCheckout` on configuration items belonging to other lineItems in the same cart.
- **Verify:** Build a cart with two configurable lineItems (L1 and L2), each with at least one config item. Call `unSelectAllCartConfigurationItems` with `lineItemId = L1.id`. Assert all config items on L1 have `selectedForCheckout = false`. Assert all config items on L2 retain their original state and `L2.listPrice` is unchanged.
- **Violation signal:** Config items on L2 are toggled when only L1's `lineItemId` was specified; `listPrice` of L2 changes after a mutation scoped to L1.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart PR #114 §Scoping.

### BL-CART-013: No-change short-circuit on configuration-item selection mutations `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When a configuration-item selection mutation is called but the resulting `selectedForCheckout` state for every affected configuration item is identical to the pre-mutation state, `UpdateConfiguredLineItemPrice` MUST NOT be executed. The cart aggregate detects the no-change condition before invoking the reprice path and short-circuits. Applies to idempotent re-sends, to `selectAll` when all already selected, and to `unSelectAll` when all already unselected.
- **Verify:** Obtain a cart with a configurable lineItem where all config items have `selectedForCheckout = true`. Call `selectAllCartConfigurationItems` for that lineItem. Assert cart totals are unchanged. Confirm `UpdateConfiguredLineItemPrice` was not triggered (via platform logs or unit test coverage). Repeat with `changeCartConfigurationItemSelected` sending the same value already set.
- **Violation signal:** Repricing executes on a no-change call; unnecessary `RecalculateAsync` invocation observable in platform logs; performance regression in batch UIs that resend full selection state on every interaction.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert

### BL-CART-014: Configuration-section identification — `(sectionId, type)` for Text/File; `option.productId` required for Variation `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When identifying a `ConfigurationItem` for selection mutations: for `Text` and `File` sections, `(sectionId, type)` alone is sufficient for unique lookup. For `Variation` sections, `option.productId` is mandatory because multiple variations of the same configurable section can coexist on a lineItem. Omitting `option` for a `Variation`-type section results in a no-op (item not found, per BL-CART-011). For `Product` sections, `option.productId` resolves the option but is not required for uniqueness when only one product placement per section is allowed.
- **Verify:** For a Variation section: call `changeCartConfigurationItemSelected` with `{sectionId, type: 'Variation'}` and no `option` field → assert silent no-op (flag does not flip). Repeat with `{sectionId, type: 'Variation', option: {productId: <valid-id>}}` → assert flag flips. For a Text section: call with `{sectionId, type: 'Text'}` and no `option` → assert flag flips (lookup succeeds). For a File section: same as Text.
- **Violation signal:** Text/File section fails without `option` field (overly strict); Variation section succeeds with missing `option` (ambiguous lookup); wrong config item toggled.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart PR #114 — `ConfigurationSectionKeyInput.cs` and `ConfigurableProductOptionKeyInput.cs`.

### BL-CART-015: Configuration items survive a Saved-for-Later round trip `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Moving a configurable lineItem to Saved for Later (`moveToSavedForLater`) and back into the cart (`moveFromSavedForLater`) MUST preserve its `configurationItems` (customText, selected option/productId, files, section) unchanged. The lineItem is re-created with a new `lineItemId` on each leg, but its configuration payload is not lost, truncated, or reset to defaults.
- **Verify:** Add a configurable product with a Text-section custom value to cart; confirm via the cart's line-item configuration view. Move it to Saved for Later. Move it back to cart. Confirm the configuration view shows the identical custom value on the new lineItem.
- **Violation signal:** The custom text/option/file is blank, reset to a default, or the section is missing entirely after the item returns to cart.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront round trip), qa-backend-expert (GraphQL fragment/response verification)
- **Source:** vc-frontend `client-app/core/api/graphql/cart/fragments/fullLineItem.graphql` (`configurationItems` block on `LineItemType`); `.../mutations/moveToSavedForLater/moveToSavedForLaterMutation.graphql` and `.../moveFromSavedForLater/moveFromSavedForLaterMutation.graphql` (both return `cart { ...fullCart }`).
- **Docs:** N/A — implementation detail: the user guide documents the Save-for-Later and product-configuration features but not this field-level persistence guarantee across the move mutations (§1a).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; MISSING → new entry, Source + Live agree, Docs N/A per §1a; scoped to single-item move, bulk not independently verified).

## Domain 3: Checkout (BL-CHK)

### BL-CHK-001: Guest vs authenticated checkout `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Guest checkout is only available when the store setting `createAnonymousOrderEnabled = true`. When disabled, anonymous users must sign in before reaching checkout. Guest checkout skips address book (no saved addresses) and order history is not linked to an account.
- **Verify:** With flag OFF → "Add to cart" → "Checkout" → redirect to sign-in. With flag ON → anonymous user can complete full checkout without account.
- **Violation signal:** Anonymous user reaches checkout when flag is OFF; guest order appears in a registered user's order history; saved addresses shown to guest.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout flow), qa-backend-expert (store settings API)
- **Source:** vc-frontend `client-app/pages/checkout/index.vue` — no auth guard on the checkout route; a guest may initialize and complete checkout, and the guest order is not linked to an account.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-CHK-002: Double-submit prevention (Place Order idempotency) `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Clicking "Place Order" twice in rapid succession must NOT create two orders. The button must be disabled after first click, and the backend must enforce idempotency (same cart token → same order).
- **Verify:** Click "Place Order" → immediately click again → only 1 order created. Check Admin → Orders → verify single order. Check button state (disabled/loading after first click).
- **Violation signal:** Two orders with same items created; button remains clickable during processing; no loading indicator.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (button state), qa-testing-expert (rapid click test), qa-backend-expert (order API dedup)

### BL-CHK-003: Address validation by country `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Checkout address forms adapt the **State/Province** requirement to the selected country, but **ZIP/Postal code is required unconditionally regardless of country** (the `postalCode` field's schema has no country branch). State/Province is required when the selected country has one or more regions and is hidden/optional otherwise. US requires state; the address must be validated before proceeding to payment.
- **Verify:** Select US → State and ZIP required. Select a country with no regions → State/Province hidden/optional, but ZIP/Postal code **still required**. Attempt to submit without ZIP → blocked before the payment step regardless of country.
- **Violation signal:** State/Province required for a country that has no regions; the address form is identical regardless of country (no region-conditional State field); ZIP silently not enforced. (Note: the earlier expectation that "countries without postal codes must not require ZIP" does NOT match the form — ZIP is always required.)
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout form), qa-backend-expert (address validation API)
- **Source:** vc-frontend `address-form.vue` — `postalCode: yup.string().trim().max(32).required()` (no country branch); `regionRules: .when("countryCode", { is: () => !!country.regions.length, then: required, otherwise: nullable })`.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (approved from bl-proposals-2026-07-22 — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22: corrected the ZIP clause — ZIP is unconditional, only State/Province is country-conditional; triangulated source + live).

### BL-CHK-004: Payment retry after decline `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a payment is declined by the gateway (insufficient funds, expired card, etc.), the user must be able to retry with a different card or correct the issue — without losing their cart or shipping selections. The checkout state (address, shipping method) must persist through payment retries. After 3 consecutive declines, the system may lock the checkout temporarily.
- **Verify:** Enter invalid card → decline message shown → change card details → retry → success. Verify shipping address and method are unchanged after decline. Check that a new order is not partially created on each decline.
- **Violation signal:** Cart emptied after payment decline; shipping address reset; partial/ghost orders created on each failed attempt; no retry option shown.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout flow), qa-testing-expert (payment decline scenarios), qa-backend-expert (payment API state)

### BL-CHK-005: Shipping method depends on address `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Available shipping methods are determined by the shipping address. Changing the address must refresh the list of available shipping methods and their rates. Previously selected shipping method that is no longer available for the new address must be deselected with a notification. BOPIS (store pickup) option depends on proximity or store assignment.
- **Verify:** Enter domestic address → see standard/express options. Change to international address → shipping methods update → rates change. Select BOPIS → change to address far from any store → BOPIS option disappears.
- **Violation signal:** Shipping methods don't update when address changes; unavailable method remains selected; rates don't change for different destinations.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout shipping step), qa-backend-expert (shipping API)
- **Source:** vc-frontend `shipping-details-section.vue` — binds `availableShippingMethods` (server-computed per cart/address); `onShipmentMethodChange` → `updateShipment`.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-CHK-006: Order total formula `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** The order total must always equal: `subTotal (sum of the list totals of items flagged selectedForCheckout) + shipping subtotal + tax total + payment subtotal + fee total − discount total (the aggregate of line-item, shipping, payment, and cart-level discounts)`. Every component is an explicit line — no hidden or unexplained differences. The total displayed at checkout must match the total on the order confirmation page and in the Admin order detail. (Source: vc-module-cart `DefaultShoppingCartTotalsCalculator.CalculateTotals` — `cart.Total = SubTotal + ShippingSubTotal + TaxTotal + PaymentSubTotal + FeeTotal − DiscountTotal`.)
- **Verify:** Manually calculate: add all line totals + shipping + tax - discounts. Compare to displayed total. After placing order → check order confirmation → check Admin order detail → all three must match.
- **Violation signal:** Total doesn't match manual calculation; checkout total differs from confirmation page; Admin order shows different amount; unexplained $0.01+ discrepancy.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout + confirmation), qa-backend-expert (order API), qa-testing-expert (cross-check)

### BL-CHK-007: Minimum order amount enforcement `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** **NOT native to Virto Commerce** (live-verified 2026-07-15: no store-level monetary minimum-order-amount setting and no native cart validator that blocks Place Order on a below-minimum subtotal — native cart validation is quantity/stock/price-based only: MinQuantity/MaxQuantity/PackSize, out-of-stock, price-changed). This invariant applies **ONLY to deployments that add a custom minimum-order validator/setting**. Where such a validator exists: when a store has a minimum order amount configured, the checkout "Place Order" button must be disabled (or checkout blocked) if the cart subtotal (after discounts) is below the minimum. The minimum applies to the subtotal, not the grand total (before shipping/tax). A clear message must indicate the minimum and the shortfall.
- **Verify:** Set min order = $50 → add items totaling $40 → checkout blocked with message "Minimum order is $50, you need $10 more." Add more items to exceed $50 → checkout unblocked.
- **Violation signal:** Order placed below minimum; no message shown; minimum checked against grand total instead of subtotal; checkout not blocked.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout flow), qa-backend-expert (order validation API)

### BL-CHK-008: Address-popup State/Province facet renders only when result set contains regionId values `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The "State/Province" facet in the address-selection popup is rendered if and only if the term aggregation for `regionId` in the current address result set returns at least one non-null value. When `term: []` (all addresses in the set have `null regionId`), the facet element is absent from the DOM — it is not rendered as an empty dropdown. This rule is data-driven: facet presence changes dynamically as the result set changes (e.g., filtering to a country whose addresses all have null regionId causes the facet to disappear). Currently: USA and Canada addresses carry non-null regionId; other countries (UK/GB, Albania, etc.) carry null regionId.
- **Verify:** Open address-selection popup with a user whose address book contains ≥1 US or CA address → "State/Province" facet visible with term values. Apply Country facet = non-US/CA country (e.g., GB) → "State/Province" facet disappears from DOM (not just empties). Remove Country filter → facet reappears. For a user with only non-US/CA addresses (e.g., Albania-only), facet must not be rendered at all.
- **Violation signal:** "State/Province" facet visible with empty/zero values when result set has no non-null regionId; facet persists in DOM after filter narrows the set to null-region addresses only; facet missing when USA/Canada addresses are present.
- **Scope:** Address-selection popup only (per VCST-4710 / PR #129); does NOT apply to the account addresses page or the ship-to popover.
- **Ground (vc-frontend source):** the facet is the Region `FacetFilter` (`data-test-id="filter-region"`, label i18n `common.labels.region`) in `select-address-filter.vue`, rendered by `select-address-modal.vue` only when its `showFilters` prop is true. It renders via `v-if="filterOptionsRegions"`; `filterOptionsRegions` (`createAddressFilterContext` in `usePickupFilterContext.ts`, facet name `RegionId`) is `undefined` unless the address result set's `term_facets` contains a `RegionId` facet — so the facet is removed from the DOM (not merely emptied) when no non-null regionId values exist.

## Domain 4: Orders & Fulfillment (BL-ORD)

### BL-ORD-001: Order state machine guards `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Payment and shipment follow strict state machines with guards:
  - **Payment:** `Pending → Authorized → Paid → Refunded`, with `Authorized → Voided` as a separate pre-capture branch. The capture operation sets `PaymentStatus = Paid` — there is **no `Captured` enum value**. Cannot capture without authorization. Cannot refund without capture (refund requires `Paid`). Void is only possible before capture (from `Authorized`, never from `Paid`). See BL-ORD-006 for the detailed transition table.
  - **Shipment:** `New → Pick & Pack → Ready to Send → Send`. Cannot mark "Send" before "Pick & Pack". No "Delivered" sub-state — delivered semantics live at ORDER level (`OrderStatus = Completed`). See BL-ORD-007 and `project_order_status_vocab` memory.
- **Verify:** In Admin → Order → attempt to skip states (e.g., capture without authorization) → should fail or button should be absent. Verify API rejects invalid state transitions.
- **Violation signal:** Payment captured without prior authorization; shipment marked "Send" while still "New"; state skipped without error.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (order API, state transitions), qa-testing-expert (Admin SPA)
- **Source:** vc-module-order `PaymentFlowService.cs` — `CaptureAllowedPaymentStatuses => [Authorized, Paid]`, `RefundAllowedPaymentStatuses => [Paid, PartiallyRefunded, Refunded]` (Voided excluded); shipment status enum = New / Pick & Pack / Ready to Send / Send (no "Delivered").
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-ORD-002: Cancellation restores inventory conditionally `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When an order is cancelled, inventory is restored ONLY if the "Adjust inventory on order cancellation" flag is enabled in store settings. Without the flag, cancellation does NOT restore stock — manual inventory adjustment required.
- **Verify:** Enable flag → cancel order → check FFC inventory (should increase). Disable flag → cancel order → inventory unchanged.
- **Violation signal:** Inventory restored when flag is OFF; inventory NOT restored when flag is ON; stock count mismatch after cancellation.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (inventory API, order API), qa-testing-expert (Admin SPA workflow)

### BL-ORD-003: Partial fulfillment rules `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** An order with multiple line items can be partially fulfilled — some items shipped while others remain pending. Each shipment tracks its own items and state independently (`New → Pick & Pack → Ready to Send → Send`, per BL-ORD-007). Virto does **NOT** auto-assign a "Partially shipped" order status — that value is not in the platform status vocabulary (BL-ORD-009). Partial-fulfillment progress is observed via per-shipment statuses; order-level completion is set at ORDER level as `OrderStatus = Completed` (a settable status), never derived from an aggregate "all shipments Delivered" (there is no `Delivered` shipment state — BL-ORD-007).
- **Verify:** Order with 3 items → create 2 shipments (items A+B in shipment 1, item C in shipment 2) → advance shipment 1 to `Send` → shipment 1 shows `Send`, shipment 2 still `New` (per-shipment states independent) → advance shipment 2 to `Send` → set the order's `OrderStatus = Completed`. Assert there is no "Partially shipped" order status and no "Delivered" shipment state.
- **Violation signal:** Order marked "Completed" while shipments are pending; partial shipment not reflected in order status; items missing from shipment tracking.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (order/shipment API), qa-testing-expert (Admin SPA)

### BL-ORD-004: Refund conditions `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Refund is only possible on a payment that has been captured. Partial refund amount must be ≤ captured amount minus any previous refunds. Full refund sets payment status to "Refunded." A voided payment cannot be refunded. Refund does not automatically restore inventory — that follows BL-ORD-002 cancellation rules separately.
- **Verify:** Attempt refund on "Authorized" (not captured) payment → rejected. Capture $100 → refund $30 → remaining refundable = $70. Refund another $80 → rejected (exceeds remaining). Void a payment → refund button absent.
- **Violation signal:** Refund allowed on uncaptured payment; partial refund exceeds captured amount; refund succeeds on voided payment; inventory auto-restored on refund without cancellation.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (payment API), qa-testing-expert (Admin refund flow)

### BL-ORD-005: Order number format and uniqueness `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Every order receives a unique order number upon creation from the store-configurable `Order.CustomerOrderNewNumberTemplate` (default format `CO{date:yyMMdd}-{counter:D5}`, counter reset type `Daily` by default — configurable to `None`/`Weekly`/`Monthly`/`Yearly`). Because the counter resets each period, sequential numbering is only guaranteed **within the active reset period**, not globally — uniqueness across periods comes from the date component, not the counter alone. Order numbers must never be reused within the same reset period, even after cancellation. The order number is immutable after creation.
- **Verify:** Place 3 orders on the same day → numbers share the day's date prefix and increment sequentially (e.g. `CO<date>-00001`, `-00002`, `-00003`). Cancel the middle order → place another same-day order → the next number continues the same-day sequence (not reused). Placing an order on a new day resets the counter to `00001` under the new date prefix — expected, not a bug.
- **Violation signal:** Duplicate order numbers *within the same reset period*; counter fails to reset at the configured boundary; order number changes after creation.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (order API), qa-frontend-expert (confirmation page)
- **Source:** vc-module-core `CounterOptions.cs` — default `ResetCounterType.Daily`; `SequenceNumberGeneratorService.ShouldResetCounter` resets the sequence at the UTC day boundary.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (approved from bl-proposals-2026-07-22 — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22: corrected globally-sequential → per-period-reset numbering, triangulated source + live).

### BL-ORD-006: Payment state machine (detailed) `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Payment states and allowed transitions:
  - `Pending` → `Authorized` (gateway authorization successful)
  - `Authorized` → `Paid` (funds captured/settled; the capture operation sets status to `Paid` — there is **no `Captured` enum value**)
  - `Authorized` → `Voided` (authorization cancelled before capture)
  - `Paid` → `Refunded` (full refund processed)
  - `Paid` → `PartiallyRefunded` (partial refund, remainder still captured)
  - Illegal: `Pending → Paid` (skipping auth), `Voided → Paid`, `Refunded → Paid`
- **Verify:** For each illegal transition, attempt via API → expect 400/422 error. In Admin, verify buttons only show valid next states.
- **Violation signal:** Any illegal transition succeeds; Admin shows buttons for invalid states; API returns 200 on illegal transition.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (payment API state machine)

### BL-ORD-007: Shipment state machine (detailed) `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Live admin Shipment Status dropdown exposes 5 values (verified 2026-04-22 on the environment):
  - `New` → `Pick & Pack` (items being prepared)
  - `Pick & Pack` → `Ready to Send`
  - `Ready to Send` → `Send` (shipped with tracking number — note admin spelling is "Send" not "Sent")
  - `Any state` → `Cancelled`
- **No "Delivered" shipment sub-state.** Delivered/fulfilled semantics are represented at the ORDER level via `OrderStatus = Completed`, not at the shipment level.
- Illegal: `New → Send` (skipping Pick & Pack and Ready to Send); reversing transitions.
- **Verify:** For each illegal transition, attempt via API → expect error. In Admin, verify available actions match current state. Tracking number required for `Send` transition.
- **Violation signal:** State skipped; shipment marked `Send` without tracking number; API allows illegal jump.
- **Storefront label mapping:** per `project_order_status_vocab` memory — admin `Send` → storefront "Shipped"; order-level `Completed` → storefront "Completed" (delivered semantics).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (shipment API), qa-testing-expert (Admin SPA)

### BL-ORD-009: Order status vocabulary `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The order status vocabulary is an **admin-editable, localizable dictionary** (`Order.Status` setting, `IsDictionary = true`, `IsLocalizable = true`) — **not** a fixed enum. Every value in the dictionary is **settable** via the Admin Order → Status dropdown (the dropdown is populated from the dictionary), and a deployment may add, rename, or remove values. The platform ships a default seed of settable values — `New`, `Not payed`, `Pending`, `Processing`, `Ready to send`, `Cancelled`, `Partially sent`, `Completed` — which deployments commonly customize (e.g. `Payment required`, `Ready for pickup`, `Custom`). The exact list and count are therefore environment-configurable; the invariant is the dictionary mechanism, not a fixed set or count.
- **`Processing` is a normal settable dictionary value — NOT read-only/computed.** It is one of the seeded `Order.Status` values and is selectable from the Status dropdown. It also serves as the default `Order.InitialProcessingStatus` (the status auto-assigned when order processing begins — mirroring `Order.InitialStatus`, default `New`, at creation), but auto-assignment does not make it read-only: an admin can set it manually and it persists.
- **System value vs display label:** The dictionary stores system values (e.g. `ReadyForPickup`), while Admin UI and storefront render localized labels (`Ready for pickup`). Tests must assert against the correct surface — see `project_order_status_vocab` memory.
- **Storefront labels may differ:** Storefront applies user-facing relabeling on top of platform status (e.g. admin `Pending` + shipment `Send` → storefront "Shipped"). Do not assume 1:1 label mapping between admin and storefront.
- **Verify:** Open Admin → Orders → any order → the Status dropdown lists the deployment's configured `Order.Status` dictionary values, with `Processing` among the selectable options. Set an `AGENT-TEST-` order to `Processing` → Save → reopen → status persists as `Processing` in the editable Status control. Confirm the settable set matches Settings → Orders → General settings → order status dictionary.
- **Violation signal:** Status dropdown does not reflect the `Order.Status` dictionary; a configured dictionary value is missing from the dropdown; a saved value does not persist; storefront shows the raw system value (`ReadyForPickup`) instead of the localized label.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (order API + `Order.Status` dictionary setting), qa-testing-expert (Admin SPA Status dropdown, storefront order history labels)
- **Source:** vc-module-order `ModuleConstants.cs` — `CustomerOrderStatus` + `Settings.General.OrderStatus` (`IsDictionary=true`, `AllowedValues` = the 8 seed values incl. `Processing`) + `OrderInitialStatus` (default `New`) / `OrderInitialProcessingStatus` (default `Processing`). Docs: PlatformUserGuide "Order management → Settings → General settings" (order statuses are admin-configurable). Live-verified: an order persists in `Processing`, shown in the editable Status control.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22: corrected the stale "Processing is read-only / exactly 7 settable" claim — `Processing` is a settable dictionary value and the set is an env-configurable dictionary, not a fixed enum; 3/3 docs+source+live).

### BL-ORD-008: Audit trail completeness `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Every order state change (status, payment, shipment) must be recorded in the order's change log with: actor (user/system), timestamp, previous state, and new state. The audit trail is append-only — entries cannot be edited or deleted. Admin users can view the full change log from the order detail blade.
- **Verify:** Place order → authorize → capture → ship → deliver. Open order change log in Admin → every transition recorded with correct actor and timestamps. Verify via API: `GET /api/order/customerOrders/{id}/changes` returns full history.
- **Violation signal:** Missing entries in change log; actor shows "system" for manual actions; timestamps out of order; change log entries editable.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (order API, change log), qa-testing-expert (Admin SPA)

### BL-ORD-010: Order totals — one entry per distinct line currency, unique default-currency flag `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `CustomerOrder.OrderTotals[]` MUST contain exactly one entry per distinct currency present across `Items[].Currency`, `Shipments[].Currency`, and `InPayments[].Currency`. The entry whose `CurrencyCode == CustomerOrder.Currency` MUST have `isDefaultTotalCurrency = true`; no other entry may. Each entry's `total/subTotal/taxTotal/discountTotal` reflect only that currency's entities. A single-currency order → exactly 1 entry. The REST `WithOrderTotals` response group (bit 9 = 512) must be requested; without it `OrderTotals` is null (not empty).
- **Verify:** Single-currency USD order → `order { orderTotals { isDefaultTotalCurrency total{currency{code}} } }` → exactly 1 entry, USD, `isDefaultTotalCurrency=true`. Mixed (USD + PTS) order → exactly 2 entries, exactly one `isDefaultTotalCurrency=true`, each subTotal = sum of its-currency lines. REST GET without `WithOrderTotals` → `orderTotals` null.

## Domain 5: Users & Authentication (BL-AUTH)

### BL-AUTH-001: Session expiry during checkout `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** If a user's session expires while in the checkout flow, the cart contents must be preserved (server-side). After re-authentication, the user should be able to resume checkout with the same cart — not start over.
- **Verify:** Start checkout → wait for session expiry (or manually expire token) → re-sign in → verify cart intact, checkout resumable from last step.
- **Violation signal:** Cart emptied after session expiry; user redirected to homepage instead of checkout; items lost.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout flow), qa-testing-expert (session manipulation)

### BL-AUTH-002: Email verification gate `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When `emailVerificationRequired = true` in store settings, newly registered users cannot access protected features (checkout, order history, account management) until they verify their email via the confirmation link. They can still browse the catalog and add items to cart. The verification link must expire after a configurable period.
- **Verify:** Register with `emailVerificationRequired = true` → attempt checkout → blocked with "Please verify your email" message. Click verification link → features unlocked. Test expired link → shows "Link expired, request a new one."
- **Violation signal:** Unverified user completes checkout; no verification prompt; expired link still works; verified status not persisted after sign-out/sign-in.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (registration + checkout), qa-backend-expert (auth API, store settings)

### BL-AUTH-003: Account lockout after N failed attempts `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** After a configurable number of consecutive failed login attempts (platform default: 5), the account is temporarily locked. During lockout, even correct credentials are rejected with a generic message (not revealing whether the account exists). Lockout duration is configurable. Successful login resets the failure counter.
- **Verify:** Enter wrong password 5 times → 6th attempt (even with correct password) → "Account locked" message. Wait for lockout expiry → successful login. Verify 4 failures + 1 success → counter resets (next failure starts from 1).
- **Violation signal:** No lockout after many failures; lockout message reveals account existence ("Account locked" vs "No such user"); lockout doesn't expire; counter not reset after success.
- **Scope:** This invariant covers **authentication-failure** lockout only (sets the global `ApplicationUser.LockoutEnd`). The **administrative org-scoped lockout** introduced by VCST-5028 (`OrganizationMembership.IsLocked`) is a distinct mechanism that deliberately does NOT set `LockoutEnd` and is governed by BL-AUTH-012 / BL-AUTH-013.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (login page), qa-backend-expert (auth API), qa-testing-expert (brute-force scenario)
- **Source:** vc-platform `AuthorizationController.Exchange()` password branch — `CheckPasswordSignInAsync(..., lockoutOnFailure: true)`.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-AUTH-004: Returning vs new customer defaults `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Shipping-address pre-fill at checkout is **config-gated and off by default.** The store's shipping-address policy setting has exactly two values — a disabled value (the **default**) and a previous-order value. Only under the previous-order value does checkout pre-fill the shipping address, and it then copies the **shipping (or billing-and-shipping) address of the customer's most recent order** — not the customer's saved address book — and only when the cart's shipment has **no** delivery address yet. Under the disabled value a returning customer sees **no** pre-filled shipping address, exactly like a first-time customer, and must select one; that is by design, not a defect. A new customer (first order) always sees empty address forms and no saved payment methods. Saved payment methods are a separate per-customer store of tokenized cards, offered only by card processors that support saving, and are **not** governed by the shipping-address policy. In every configuration the system must not show addresses or payment methods belonging to another account, even if the email was reused across organizations.
- **Verify:** Read the store's shipping-address policy setting first — the expected result depends on it. Disabled value (default) → sign in as a customer **with** prior orders → checkout → the shipping section prompts for an address selection and nothing is pre-filled. Previous-order value → same customer → checkout → the shipping address matches the most recent order's shipping address; then set a delivery address on the shipment first and re-enter checkout → the existing address is **not** overwritten. Any value → brand-new account with no orders → empty address form, no saved cards. Sign in as a different user → no cross-contamination of addresses.
- **Violation signal:** Checkout pre-fills a shipping address while the policy is at its disabled value, or fails to pre-fill while it is at the previous-order value; pre-fill overwrites a delivery address already chosen on the shipment; pre-fill draws from the saved address book rather than the most recent order; a brand-new customer sees pre-filled data; addresses or saved cards from another account are displayed. NOTE: a returning customer seeing an empty address form under the **default** (disabled) policy is **expected** — do not file it.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout forms), qa-backend-expert (store settings, cart shipment context)
- **Source:** `vc-module-x-order` `src/VirtoCommerce.XOrder.Core/ModuleConstants.cs` (`ShippingAddressPolicy` descriptor — two allowed values, default = the disabled one) + `src/VirtoCommerce.XOrder.Data/Middlewares/ShipmentContextMiddleware.cs` (`GetShippingPolicy` plus the early return unless the policy is the previous-order value, the `shipment?.DeliveryAddress != null` short-circuit, and the single-result last-order lookup taking the billing-and-shipping/shipping address). Docs: storefront user guide, Checkout → Shipping — "If Shipping address policy is enabled in the Platform, the shipping address on the Shipping page will be prefilled with the most recently used address." Live-confirmed on the environment: the policy read back as its disabled value, and a signed-in customer's checkout showed no pre-filled shipping address while a customer with no order history saw an empty form. The previous-order branch is source+docs-grounded only — it was not exercised live (it requires the store setting to be changed).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). Corrected the unconditional "returning customer sees pre-filled saved addresses" claim: pre-fill is gated by the store's shipping-address policy (default **off**), sources the **most recent order's** address rather than the saved address book, and skips a shipment that already carries a delivery address. The cross-account isolation clause is unchanged.

### BL-AUTH-005: RBAC 6-permission model `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Every module in Virto Commerce follows the same permission-claim model built from a canonical base set — `access`, `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete` (the 5-permission module template in `ModuleConstants.cs`) — plus `export` on modules that support data export, and further module-specific extensions (e.g. Orders adds `read_prices` / `update_shipments`). The commonly-used "6-permission" shorthand = the base 5 + `export`. Permissions are assigned to roles, and roles are assigned to users. A user without `create` permission on a module must not see the "Create" button in Admin. API calls without the required permission must return 403 Forbidden.
- **Role whitelist is NOT a permission boundary (VCST-5239):** the Customer-module Organization/Membership role **whitelists** populate assignment dropdowns only; they are **not** server-enforced — assigning a non-whitelisted role via xAPI `changeOrganizationContactRole` / REST succeeds (`succeeded:true`). The `access/read/…/403` model governs module *operations*, not which roles may be *assigned*. Do NOT treat a non-whitelisted-role assignment as a 403/security case unless a server boundary is later added.
- **Verify:** Create a role with only `read` on Catalog → assign to user → sign in as that user → "Create" and "Delete" buttons absent in Catalog blade. Attempt `POST /api/catalog/products` → 403. Add `create` permission → button appears.
- **Violation signal:** Buttons visible for unauthorized actions; API returns 200 instead of 403; user can create/delete without permission; `access` permission not required to enter module.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (RBAC API, Admin SPA), qa-testing-expert (permission testing)
- **Source:** Platform docs "Global permissions" (the module permission template is `access/read/create/update/delete`; Orders extends it with `read_prices`) + `vc-platform` `ClaimsPrincipalExtensions.cs:61-71` (`HasGlobalPermission` = reserved-administrator short-circuit, else the permission claim must be held) + `vc-module-customer` `ModuleConstants.cs:14-34` (base 5 plus a module-specific `invite`, and a separate organization-membership permission group) with `OrganizationMembershipController.cs:22,34,80,92,119,129,137` gating each action by permission. Live-confirmed on the environment: the registered permission catalog is dominated by the base-5 verbs across every module group, `export` appears only on the few modules that support data export, and a storefront-scoped token carrying no platform permission claims received 403 from three permission-gated admin endpoints. The Admin-SPA button-visibility half of `Verify` was not re-observed this run (docs + source cover the UI-gating mechanism).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). No Rule change; `Source:` added with docs + source + live anchors.

### BL-AUTH-006: Role hierarchy `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Virto Commerce roles are independent permission-claim sets, **NOT** a built-in inheritance hierarchy — a role has exactly the permissions assigned to it and does not automatically inherit a lower role's permissions. The role entity carries no parent, base, extends, or child field of any kind. Three names are **reserved system roles** carried on the account rather than rows in the role list (administrator, manager, customer); every other role is **per-deployment data** — role names and their permission sets are created per deployment and must be read from the environment, never assumed to exist. Administrator power is a **short-circuit, not inheritance**: a principal in the reserved administrator system role passes every global permission check without holding the claim, while everyone else must hold the specific permission claim. Within that model: An Administrator can perform any action. Store Managers can manage their assigned store(s) but not platform settings. Customers can only access their own data — a storefront account is an account category, not a platform role, and typically holds no platform role at all (its rights arrive as organization-scoped claims). Anonymous users are limited to browsing (if `anonymousUsersAllowed = true`) — an unauthenticated state, not a role.
- **Verify:** Read the environment's role list first and pick roles that actually exist there rather than assuming a role by name. Assert no role exposes a parent/inheritance field, and that a role's effective permissions equal exactly what was assigned to it. Store Manager → can manage products, orders for assigned store → cannot access Platform Settings blade. Customer → can view own orders → cannot access Admin SPA. Anonymous → can browse catalog (if flag ON) → cannot access cart/checkout (if guest checkout OFF). Confirm an account in the reserved administrator system role passes a permission check for a permission no role grants it.
- **Violation signal:** Lower role accesses higher-role functions; Store Manager modifies platform settings; customer sees other customers' orders; anonymous user bypasses access restrictions; a role gains permissions it was never assigned (would imply inheritance); a non-administrator passes a permission check without holding the claim.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA, roles API), qa-frontend-expert (storefront permissions)
- **Source:** Platform docs "Authorization in Virto Commerce" (authorization is by permission claim; a role is a collection of permissions grouped for assignment — no inheritance described) + `vc-platform` `PlatformConstants.cs:46-51` (the three reserved system roles) and `ClaimsPrincipalExtensions.cs:61-71` (`HasGlobalPermission` short-circuits for the administrator system role, else requires the claim). Live-confirmed on the environment: the role search returns role objects with no parent/base/extends/child field, and of the five names previously listed as tiers only the store-manager role existed as a data role.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). The no-inheritance core is unchanged and all behavioural assertions are preserved verbatim; the five-name "privilege tier" list was replaced with the grounded distinction (reserved system roles vs per-deployment data roles vs an unauthenticated state) because only one of the five names resolved to a role on the audited build and one resolved to nothing, which made the `Verify` steps unexecutable as written.

### BL-AUTH-007: Storefront logout UX — popup-only `[P1-ux]` `[GOLDEN RULE]`
- **Rule:** The storefront exposes logout **only** inside the account-menu popup in the top header. There is no `/sign-out` page, no `/logout` page, and no standalone logout icon in the header. Correct sequence: (1) click the account button `data-test-id="account-button"` in the top-right header — opens the account-menu popup (`data-test-id="account-menu"`); (2) click the logout button **inside that popup**, selector `data-test-id="sign-out-button"`. Note the storefront test attribute is `data-test-id` (hyphenated) with the **flat** value `sign-out-button` — `data-testid` is not used in vc-frontend and there is no dotted-path value. (vc-frontend source: `client-app/shared/layout/components/header/_internal/top-header.vue`; composable `useSignMeOut`; routes `client-app/router/routes/main.ts` + `constants.ts` confirm no `/sign-out` or `/logout` route — logout calls `signMeOut` which clears the session and reloads through the auth guard.)
- **Verify:** Navigating to `/sign-out` and `/logout` must not resolve to a logout page (they fall through to the catch-all 404). Header nav must not contain a top-level logout button. Clicking `data-test-id="account-button"` opens the popup; clicking `data-test-id="sign-out-button"` inside it signs the user out, and the auth guard redirects to the sign-in route carrying a `returnUrl` for the page that was open. The popup control is an **icon-only** button — its visible content is a logout glyph and its accessible name/title is the localized "Logout" label — so locate it by `data-test-id="sign-out-button"`, never by visible text.
- **Violation signal:** A `/sign-out` route renders a page; a header-level logout button exists; logout works only via a URL (no popup); the popup logout selector `data-test-id="sign-out-button"` (inside `data-test-id="account-menu"`) is missing.
- **Applies to:** All test cases whose Steps say "sign out", "log out", "Click logout button", or "Navigate to /sign-out" — agents MUST execute the popup sequence and reviewers MUST reject the loose/wrong Step text in favor of the popup sequence.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront), qa-testing-expert (execution), test-management-specialist (CSV review)
- **Source:** `vc-frontend` `client-app/shared/layout/components/header/_internal/top-header.vue` — `account-button` → `account-menu` popup → `sign-out-button` (an icon-only button titled with the localized logout label) wired to `signMeOut` from `useSignMeOut`; `client-app/router/routes/main.ts` declares only a sign-in page and a repo-wide search of the router directory finds no sign-out/logout route. Live-confirmed on the environment: both URLs render the 404 catch-all, the authenticated header carries no logout control, and the popup control signs the user out through the auth guard. Docs axis: N/A — the storefront user guide has no sign-out topic, and the invariant's substance is the route-absence + selector contract (QA methodology).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). Rule unchanged; added the source/live anchor and the icon-only-control precision to `Verify`.

### BL-AUTH-008: Self-impersonation must have a defined non-circular outcome `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When an operator with `CanImpersonate` navigates to `/account/impersonate/{ownUserId}` (their own platform user ID), the result must be a defined, non-circular outcome: (a) session cleared with redirect to `/sign-in`, (b) a handled error page, or (c) a redirect to home with the operator's own session intact and no impersonation banner. The system must NOT enter a circular state where the banner shows "Operator logged in as Operator" or an infinite redirect loop.
- **Verify:** Authenticated SUPPORT_AGENT navigates to `/account/impersonate/@td(SUPPORT_AGENT.userId)` → outcome is one of the three acceptable states; no banner showing the operator as both impersonator and target; no infinite redirect loop in Network panel.
- **Violation signal:** Banner displays "{operator name} logged in as {operator name}"; infinite redirect loop (>5 consecutive redirects between `/account/impersonate/...` and other routes); session enters a wedged state where neither operator nor target is authenticated and no error is shown.
- **Applies to:** IMP-017 (suite 082-auth-impersonation). Any future case that exercises the self-target path of the impersonation route.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront route guard), qa-backend-expert (`/connect/token grant_type=impersonate` self-target rejection)

### BL-AUTH-009: Nested impersonation forbidden — no silent path from impersonated session `[P0-security]`
- **Rule:** An impersonated session must not be able to silently impersonate a third user. **Enforcement is server-side, NOT a storefront form gate.** The storefront does NOT re-prompt: in `client-app/pages/account/impersonate.vue`, `canSkipVerification = isAuthenticated && (!!operator || checkPermissions(PlatformPermissions.CanImpersonate))` — an already-impersonated session HAS `operator` set, so `canSkipVerification` is TRUE and the **silent path** runs (`useImpersonate().impersonateAuthenticated(targetUserId)` → POST `/connect/token grant_type=impersonate` with the current token); `ImpersonateForm` renders only in the `v-else`. Therefore chained impersonation MUST be blocked by the token endpoint — `/connect/token grant_type=impersonate` must **reject a request issued with an already-impersonated token** — and cannot rely on the form.
- **⚠️ CURRENTLY VIOLATED (live-confirmed 2026-07-15 — OPEN privilege-escalation defect):** the token endpoint does **NOT** reject a chained impersonation. A session already impersonating User-A (whose own token carries **no** `loginOnBehalf` permission) successfully minted a fresh impersonation token for a third User-B (**HTTP 200**), with the original operator preserved in `vc_operator_user_id`. Control proof: the same principal (A) gets **403** impersonating B on its own plain token, but **200** when the request rides the impersonated token. **Root cause** — `vc-platform` `src/VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web/Controllers/Api/AuthorizationController.cs` `IsImpersonateGrantType()`: the `SecurityLoginOnBehalf` permission check is guarded by `IsNullOrEmpty(OperatorUserId)`, so it is **skipped whenever the presented token already has an operator claim** — conflating "reset back to operator" (empty `user_id`) with "retarget to an arbitrary new `user_id`". Fix direction: run the permission check whenever a non-empty `user_id` is supplied, regardless of an existing operator claim. Any leaked impersonated token becomes a skeleton key (pivot to any user, no operator creds). Until fixed, treat this as the known violation state, not a test bug. Bug drafted: `reports/bugs/BUG-nested-impersonation-privilege-escalation.md`.
- **Verify:** From a session already impersonating User-A, navigate to the impersonate route for User-B → the silent path fires (**no form is expected**). At the network layer, `/connect/token grant_type=impersonate` on the impersonated token **currently returns HTTP 200** (a chained token) — the expected-post-fix behavior is a rejection (4xx, no token issued).
- **Violation signal:** The backend issues a chained impersonation token from an already-impersonated session (privilege escalation) — **currently the case**. NOTE: the storefront form NOT rendering is **expected** (it is not the enforcement point) — do not treat that as the violation.
- **Applies to:** IMP-013 (suite 082-auth-impersonation). Security audits of the impersonation token chain.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (`/connect/token` chain enforcement), qa-frontend-expert (silent-flow gate condition)

### BL-AUTH-010: Impersonation banner must persist across SPA navigation `[P1-ux]`
- **Rule:** Once an impersonation session is active, the banner `[operator name] + "logged in as" + [Account menu: target name]` must remain visible on every storefront page until the operator explicitly stops the impersonation. The banner must NOT disappear on route changes, modal opens, or async data loads. This includes navigation to: home, category pages, product detail, cart, checkout, account pages, search results, and CMS pages.
- **Verify:** Start impersonation → verify the banner on home → navigate by **clicking internal links** (not reloading) to the catalog, cart, checkout, and account pages → the banner is present at each, and its DOM element is the *same* node throughout (accessibility-tree references are stable across the transitions, not re-created). The banner is not a page-level bar: it is three top-header elements — `data-test-id="operator-name-label"` (the operator), the localized "logged in as" label, and `data-test-id="account-button"` carrying the target's name — rendered inside the persistent `data-test-id="top-header"` layout component, outside the router view.
- **Violation signal:** Banner disappears on any storefront route except the explicit Stop Impersonation action; banner re-renders inconsistently (flicker); banner missing on cart or checkout (revenue-critical pages); banner shows operator/target names that don't match the live session.
- **Applies to:** IMP-011 (suite 082-auth-impersonation). Cross-cutting regression for any new storefront layout/route changes.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront layout + route persistence)
- **Source:** `vc-frontend` `client-app/shared/layout/components/header/_internal/top-header.vue` — the `v-if="operator"` block renders `operator-name-label` plus the localized logged-in-as label, with the target's name on `account-button`; all inside the persistent `top-header` element, so a route change cannot unmount it. `operator` is supplied by `useUser()`. Live-confirmed on the environment: across four click-driven route transitions (home, catalog, cart, account dashboard) the banner stayed rendered with stable DOM node identity. A mobile-menu counterpart exists in the header's mobile menu component but was **not** verified live — this invariant is asserted for the desktop top header. Docs axis: N/A — the published login-on-behalf guide covers only the Admin-side entry point, not the storefront banner.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). Rule unchanged; `Verify` now names the three banner elements and requires DOM-identity (not just presence) across click-driven SPA transitions, and the mobile surface is explicitly out of scope.

### BL-AUTH-011: Stop Impersonation must restore operator session without sign-in round-trip `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Stopping impersonation must restore the original operator's authenticated session **without a sign-in round-trip** — no redirect to the sign-in route and no re-authentication prompt. The action is the **"Back to operator" row inside the account-menu popup** (`data-test-id="back-to-operator-row"`, label "Back to {operator name}"), NOT a button in the banner. It calls `useImpersonate().backToOperator()` → `revertImpersonate(...)` → `requestImpersonateToken("", ...)`, which POSTs `/connect/token` with `grant_type=impersonate` and an **empty `user_id`** — minting a **fresh operator session** (never `grant_type=password`). The restored operator tokens are written to storage and **then** the tab performs a full-page navigation (`location.href`) to the operator landing route (other tabs reload via broadcast). Because the operator token is persisted **before** the reload, no re-auth occurs. (vc-frontend source: `useImpersonate` `backToOperator`/`revertImpersonate`; account-menu popup row `back-to-operator-row`.)
- **Verify:** Operator starts impersonating target → confirms banner → clicks the "Back to operator" row (`data-test-id="back-to-operator-row"`) → the `/connect/token grant_type=impersonate` call carries an **empty `user_id`** (no `grant_type=password`); the URL does **NOT** go to the sign-in route; after the navigation the account menu shows the operator name (not target).
- **Violation signal:** Stopping impersonation redirects to the sign-in route (operator must re-authenticate); account menu shows "Sign in" instead of operator name (session lost); a `grant_type=password` call is made. NOTE: a full-page navigation to the operator landing route **is expected by design** — it is NOT a violation (the operator token is persisted before the reload, so the session survives).
- **Applies to:** IMP-012 (suite 082-auth-impersonation). Any regression that touches the impersonation token-stack restore logic.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront stop-impersonation handler), qa-backend-expert (operator token re-activation)
- **Source:** `vc-frontend` `client-app/shared/account/composables/useImpersonate.ts` — `backToOperator()` → `revertImpersonate(<company-members landing route>)` → `requestImpersonateToken("")`, which POSTs the token endpoint with `grant_type=impersonate`, `scope=offline_access` and an **empty** `user_id`, writes all four token values to storage, and only **then** broadcasts and performs the full-page navigation (the ordering is called out as an invariant in the source comment). Control row `back-to-operator-row` in `client-app/shared/layout/components/header/_internal/top-header.vue`. Live-confirmed on the environment: the captured request body was exactly `grant_type=impersonate&scope=offline_access&user_id=` → HTTP 200, no password grant occurred, the tab landed on the company-members route rather than sign-in, and the account menu showed the operator with no impersonation banner and no re-authentication prompt. Docs axis: N/A — the token-grant and reload mechanics have no published guide coverage.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). Rule unchanged (every clause held, including the expected full-page navigation); the source anchor and the live request-body evidence were recorded.

### BL-AUTH-012: Org-scoped lockout does not touch the global account `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Setting `OrganizationMembership.IsLocked = true` for (userId, orgX) MUST NOT set `ApplicationUser.LockoutEnd`. `GET /api/platform/security/users/{userId}/locked` MUST remain `{"locked": false}`, and the user MUST still authenticate into any other organization whose membership is unlocked. (VCST-5028 — the exact regression the feature exists to prevent: the old handler globally locked the shared user.)
- **Verify:** Lock membership in org X via `POST /api/customer/organization-memberships/{id}/lock` → `GET /api/platform/security/users/{userId}/locked` returns `locked: false` → `/connect/token` with `organization_id=X` → HTTP 400 `code: user_is_locked_in_organization` → `/connect/token` with `organization_id=Y` (same user, unlocked) → HTTP 200. **The 400 requires X to be the user's ONLY accessible organization** (or a non-`password` grant): on a `password` grant, a user who also has an accessible org Y is **silently fallen back to Y and gets HTTP 200 with no error** — see BL-AUTH-016. Use a single-org fixture, or assert the refusal on a non-`password` grant, or the step reads as a false PASS/FAIL depending on the fixture's org count. Two further traps: the **no-`organization_id`** variant of the same call returns **HTTP 200 with no organization context** rather than any refusal (the chain resolves nothing — BL-AUTH-015), so a refusal must be asserted on the explicit-org form; and the global-lock state must be read from the `/locked` endpoint, because the by-id platform-user payload can come back successful but **empty**, in which case a test reading `isLockedOut` off it sees `undefined` and passes without proving anything.
- **Violation signal:** Global `locked: true` after an org-scoped lock; login to a non-locked org fails with the same credentials.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (organization-memberships REST, security API)
- **Source:** `vc-module-customer` `OrganizationMembership.cs:16-22` (lock state lives on the membership; `IsCurrentlyLocked` = `IsLocked` && not expired) + `OrganizationMembershipController.cs:118-133` (lock/unlock act on the membership id only) + `OrganizationIdRequestValidator.cs:92,115` (the org-scoped refusal) against the independent global-lock path at `:38-41` and `:129-134` (which reads the platform account's lockout). Live-confirmed on the environment: after an org-scoped lock the global locked flag stayed false for both a single-org and a multi-org fixture, the single-org explicit-org grant returned the org lock code, and the multi-org `password` grant naming the locked org returned 200 on the accessible org. Docs axis: N/A — the published guides document blocking a company member as a user action but nothing about the token endpoint's `organization_id` or lock scope; the contract shipped in the change under audit (waived).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). Rule unchanged and the 2026-08-04 conditional-400 correction independently re-confirmed; `Verify` gained the no-explicit-org variant and the empty-user-payload trap.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-04 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUTH-2026-08-04). Rule unchanged (org lock ≠ global lock still holds); the `Verify` step's unconditional 400 was corrected — it is conditional on grant type + the absence of an accessible fallback org.
- **Source:** `vc-module-customer` `OrganizationIdRequestValidator.cs` `ValidateOrganizationAccessAsync` (the `allowFallback` branch returns `null`, i.e. no error, whenever a fallback org resolves) + `ErrorDescriber.cs` `UserIsLockedInOrganization`; live-confirmed on the environment (a multi-org user's `password` grant naming a blocked org returns 200 on the fallback org).

### BL-AUTH-013: Org-scoped access refusal is distinct from global lockout, and per-cause `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** An org-scoped refusal from `/connect/token` MUST carry `error: invalid_grant` plus a **cause-specific `code`** — never a global lockout code (`user_is_locked_out` / `user_is_temporary_locked_out`). There are **two independent refusal axes**, each with its own code(s):
  - **LOCK axis** (`OrganizationMembership.IsLocked` + `LockoutEnd` → `IsCurrentlyLocked`): `user_is_locked_in_organization`.
  - **STATUS axis** (the membership's effective status, per BL-B2B-013) — one code per blocking status: `Invited` → `user_invitation_pending_in_organization`; `Rejected` → `user_is_rejected_in_organization`; `Deleted` → `user_is_removed_from_organization`.
  - A requested organization the user is **not associated with at all** yields `invalid_organization_id`, but **only on a non-`password` grant** (on a `password` grant it is silently substituted — see BL-AUTH-016).

  Every code is the snake_case of its describer method, so a renamed method silently renames the wire contract. The storefront sign-in form AND the org switcher MUST surface org-specific copy (e.g. "…access to this organization has been blocked…"), not the generic global-lockout message. Refusals are subject to BL-AUTH-016's fallback and no-org-resolved conditions — this invariant governs **which code** is returned when a refusal is returned, not **whether** one is.
- **Verify:** For each cause, put a **single-accessible-org** user into that state, then `/connect/token` (`grant_type=password`, a store identifier, and `organization_id` naming that org) → assert `error == "invalid_grant"` and the exact `code` from the table above; assert `errors[]` carries **exactly one** entry whose `code` matches (BL-AUTH-016). Do **not** assert on the response's `count` field — it is the token response's parameter count, not an error count, and reads greater than one on a single-error refusal. Storefront `/sign-in` or an org-switch into the refused org → assert org-specific copy, distinct from the global-lockout copy.
- **Violation signal:** A global lockout code is returned for an org-scoped refusal; two different causes collapse onto the same code (a caller cannot tell "invitation pending" from "removed"); a blocking status returns the LOCK code or vice-versa (see BL-AUTH-016 for the deliberate lock-wins precedence); the storefront shows the generic lockout message.

- **Source:** `vc-module-customer` `ErrorDescriber.cs:9-49` (all five describers; each `Code` is the snake_case of its method name, so renaming a method silently renames the wire contract) + `OrganizationIdRequestValidator.cs:118-127` (the status→code switch) and `:61-67` (the unassociated-organization path, gated to non-`password` grants), against the independent global-lockout path at `:38-41` and `:76-85`. Live-confirmed on the environment: each of the three blocking statuses returned its own distinct code from a single-org fixture on an explicit-org `password` grant, with exactly one entry in the error list; the unassociated-organization code was returned on a non-`password` grant and silently substituted on a `password` grant. The storefront-copy half of `Verify` was not re-observed this run. Docs axis: N/A — no published guide covers the token endpoint's org error codes; the contract shipped in the change under audit (waived).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). Rule and code table unchanged; the 2026-08-04 "Rejected / Deleted are source-only" caveat is **retired** — all three status codes were observed live this run. `Verify` gained the response-shape guard.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-04 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUTH-2026-08-04). Extended from the LOCK axis only to **both** axes with the per-status code table, and scoped to "which code" rather than "whether a refusal occurs".
- **Source:** `vc-module-customer` `ErrorDescriber.cs` (all five describers; `Code = nameof(...).ToSnakeCase()`) + `OrganizationIdRequestValidator.cs` `GetStatusError` (the status→code switch) and `HandleUnavailableOrganizationAsync` (the `invalid_organization_id` path). Live: the `Invited` → `user_invitation_pending_in_organization` mapping was observed on the environment; the `Rejected` / `Deleted` codes are **source-only this run** (their live probe needs a single-org fixture at that status driven through an explicit-`organization_id` grant). Docs axis: N/A — no published guide covers the token endpoint's org error codes (waived).

### BL-AUTH-014: Admin/Platform API cookie-auth challenge returns a status code, never a login-page redirect `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When cookie authentication challenges a request whose path's first segment is `api` (case-insensitive; a path that merely starts with the string "api", e.g. `/apiary/...`, does NOT match) or that carries the header `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`, the response is a direct status code — 401 if unauthenticated, 403 if authenticated but forbidden — with no `Location` header and no login-page HTML body. Any other cookie-authentication challenge (e.g. the OIDC `/connect/authorize` flow) still issues a 302 redirect to the login page, so browser-driven authorization flows are unaffected.
- **Verify:** Unauthenticated `GET` to an `/api/platform/**` endpoint → 401, no `Location` header, body is not login-page HTML. Authenticated-but-forbidden call to an `/api/**` endpoint → direct 403 (not the old 302→AccessDenied→404 chain). A path that merely starts with the string "api" but isn't the `/api` segment (e.g. `/apiary/...`) is NOT treated as an API path. An AJAX/XHR request outside `/api` (e.g. SignalR hub negotiation) carrying `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` also gets a direct status code. Unauthenticated navigation to `/connect/authorize` still redirects (302) to the login page.
- **Violation signal:** An unauthenticated `/api/**` call returns 200 with login-page HTML, or a 302 with a `Location` header, instead of a direct 401; an authenticated-but-forbidden `/api/**` call falls through a 302→AccessDenied→404 chain instead of a direct 403; a path like `/apiary/...` is incorrectly treated as an API path (false-positive segment match).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA / Platform API), qa-testing-expert (live confirmation)
- **Source:** `ApiCookieRedirectHandler.cs` `IsApiRequest()` (`Path.StartsWithSegments("/api", OrdinalIgnoreCase)` OR `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`) + `Startup.cs` `OnRedirectToLogin` → 401 / `OnRedirectToAccessDenied` → 403 wiring; xUnit `ApiCookieRedirectHandlerTests.cs` (VCST-5618). **The fix is merged — the handler, its wiring and its tests are all on the platform default branch as of 2026-08-05.** Live-re-confirmed on the environment: unauthenticated calls to two distinct `/api/platform/**` endpoints each returned 401 with an empty body and no `Location` header, and `/apiary/...` returned 404 rather than 401/302. The "other cookie challenges still redirect (302)" clause remains **source-only** — a live probe of the authorization endpoint returned a 400 from request validation before any cookie challenge fired, so the redirect branch was not exercised. Docs axis: N/A — no PlatformDeveloperGuide coverage of this status-code contract (waived).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). Rule and Verify unchanged; the "not-yet-merged PR" caveat is discharged (merged to the default branch and live-re-confirmed), and the still-source-only redirect clause is now labelled as such.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-30 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-30; source+live CONFIRMED, docs waived).

### BL-AUTH-015: Active organization resolves by a fixed 5-step chain over *accessible* orgs only `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** At token issuance the active organization is resolved by a **fixed, ordered chain**, and every step is constrained to organizations the user can actually access:
  1. the request's explicit `organization_id` parameter, if present;
  2. else the principal's existing `organization_id` claim (a re-issue keeps its org);
  3. else the contact's `CurrentOrganizationId`, **if accessible**;
  4. else the contact's `DefaultOrganizationId`, **if accessible**;
  5. else the **first accessible** organization in the contact's own organization order.

  **Accessible** is a two-axis predicate over (userId, orgId): `NOT IsCurrentlyLocked` **AND** the membership's effective status (BL-B2B-013) is not a blocking status (`Invited` / `Rejected` / `Deleted`). An org with **no membership row** is not excluded by that row's absence — the predicate still runs for it, and the effective status falls through to the contact's own status, so such an org is accessible exactly when the contact's status is non-blocking (and correctly denied when it is not). The predicate is skipped entirely in only two cases: an absent userId, or an empty list of associated organizations — an empty *membership* list is not one of them.
  Steps 3–5 are the only ones that consult accessibility ordering; steps 1–2 are honoured first, which is why a storefront that resends the last-used org (it does) overrides both `CurrentOrganizationId` and `DefaultOrganizationId`. `CurrentOrganizationId` and `DefaultOrganizationId` are **status-filtered here**, so a default org that has become blocking is skipped rather than pinned.
  **Resolution is not read-only.** Whenever the request carries an `organization_id` that differs from the contact's stored value, the resolved org is **persisted back** to `CurrentOrganizationId` — and because a refusal-avoiding fallback or substitution rewrites that request parameter (BL-AUTH-016), a **silently substituted** org is persisted too. The write is skipped for impersonation grants. So step 3 reads a value that earlier token grants may already have moved.
  If the chain resolves **nothing**, the grant is **not refused** — it succeeds with no organization at all (see BL-AUTH-016).
- **Verify:** Multi-org user, `password` grant naming org Y explicitly → active org is Y even when the contact's `CurrentOrganizationId` is X (step 1 beats step 3). Re-read the contact after that grant → `CurrentOrganizationId` is now Y (the write-back), so re-read stored state between steps instead of assuming the seeded value. Switch orgs through the real UI, then sign out and sign in again → the resend/persisted org is honoured, not the previous first-accessible one. Put a single-org user's only membership at a blocking status → sign in with **no** explicit `organization_id` → the org is absent from the resolved context (org switcher and org-scoped navigation are gone), not merely refused. A contact with organization associations but no membership rows → accessible per the contact's own status. Confirm the switcher lists only accessible orgs.
- **Violation signal:** A blocked or blocking-status org is selected as active; `DefaultOrganizationId` is pinned despite being inaccessible; an explicit `organization_id` is ignored in favour of the contact's stored org; a user with associations but no membership rows is denied every org **while their contact status is non-blocking**; the resolved org is not persisted, or a substituted org is persisted for a grant type that should not write.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (token endpoint, memberships), qa-frontend-expert (org switcher, post-login context)
- **Source:** `vc-module-customer` `OrganizationAccessResolver.cs:14-40` (steps 3–5) and `:42-79` (the two-axis predicate; the skip at `:48-51` is keyed on an absent userId or empty organization list, and the per-org branch at `:64-77` evaluates a null membership through the contact-status fallthrough) + `OrganizationIdRequestValidator.cs:136-151` (steps 1–2) + `OrganizationMembership.cs:22,26-34` (`IsCurrentlyLocked`, `ResolveEffectiveStatus`) + `ModuleConstants.cs:51-54` (blocking statuses) + `CurrentOrganizationIdTokenRequestHandler.cs:16-43` (the write-back, and its impersonation skip). Live-confirmed on the environment: step-1 precedence over the stored org; a stored current org honoured over the first-listed org; a zero-membership-row contact resolving and accepting an explicit org; all three blocking-status single-org fixtures signing in with no explicit org and receiving no organization claim; and the write-back observed moving a contact's stored org, after which the next no-org grant resolved the new value. The ordering **between** steps 3 and 4 remains source-only — no fixture carries a default organization, so it was not isolated live. Docs axis: N/A — the published guides describe multi-organization switching as a feature but no resolution order, accessibility predicate, or persistence; the behaviour shipped in the change under audit (waived).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). Two corrections to the 2026-08-04 text: the empty-membership-list case was described as "the filter is skipped" when the skip is keyed on an absent userId or an empty associated-org list — the filter does run and falls through to the contact's status, so the old violation signal would have flagged correct behaviour as a bug; and the resolution's **write-back** of the resolved (or substituted) org onto the contact was missing entirely.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (triangulated — BL-AUTH-2026-08-04; source+live agree, docs waived).

### BL-AUTH-016: An org refusal is a single code, lock-first, and only when no fallback remains `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When the requested organization is one the user is associated with but cannot currently access, the outcome is decided in this order:
  1. **Fallback first (on a `password` grant only).** The request is silently re-pointed at the first accessible organization and returns **HTTP 200 with no error**. This is deliberate: the storefront resends the last-used org on every password login, so a blocked org there is never a deliberate choice, and one blocked org must not lock the user out of the others. An **explicit** org switch on an existing session (a non-`password` grant) gets **no** fallback.
  2. **Refusal only if nothing remains.** If no accessible organization resolves (or the grant is not `password`), exactly **one** error is returned — never a list of every applicable cause.
  3. **Lock beats status.** When a membership is simultaneously locked **and** at a blocking status, the single returned code is the LOCK code (`user_is_locked_in_organization`); the status code is computed but discarded. Restoring the lock restores the status code.

  A grant that resolves **no** organization at all is **not** a refusal — it succeeds and the session simply carries no organization context (org-scoped navigation absent). So "cannot access org X" and "is refused sign-in" are different outcomes, and only the explicit-`organization_id` form produces the refusal.
- **Verify:** Single-accessible-org user, membership both locked and at a blocking status → `password` grant naming that org → exactly one error, code `user_is_locked_in_organization`; unlock → the same call returns the status code instead; re-lock → back to the lock code. Multi-org user with one blocked org → `password` grant naming the blocked org → **HTTP 200**, active org is the accessible one (no error). Same request as a non-`password` grant → refused with the lock code; take the refresh token **fresh** for that assertion, since a consumed one fails with a code-less `invalid_grant` that is easily mistaken for the org refusal. Single-org user at a blocking status signing in with **no** explicit org → HTTP 200, session has no organization. Count errors from the `errors[]` array, never from the response's `count` field (that is the parameter count).
- **Violation signal:** More than one error code returned for one refusal; the status code returned while the membership is locked (precedence inverted); a `password` grant refused outright when another accessible org exists (the fallback regressed — this locks a multi-org user out of orgs they can still use); a non-`password` org switch silently succeeding on an inaccessible org (the fallback leaking into the explicit-switch path).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (token endpoint, memberships REST), qa-frontend-expert (sign-in, org switcher)
- **Source:** `vc-module-customer` `OrganizationIdRequestValidator.cs:28` (`allowFallback` is set from the `password` grant type only), `:87-116` (`isLocked` and `statusError` are computed independently, the fallback branch returns no error whenever an accessible org resolves, and the terminal expression yields a single response with the lock code winning) and `:61-74` (the unassociated-organization path: refusal on a non-`password` grant, substitution on `password`). Live-confirmed on the environment: the three-state lock/status walk returned exactly one code each time with the lock code winning and the status code restored on unlock; a `password` grant naming a locked org succeeded on the accessible org while a freshly-issued non-`password` grant for the same org was refused with the lock code (controls on the accessible org and with no org both succeeded); and a blocking-status single-org user with no explicit org signed in with no organization context.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-05 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-05). Rule unchanged — all three ordering rules independently reproduced; `Verify` gained the stale-refresh-token and `count`-field traps, and the non-`password` refusal is now live-confirmed rather than inferred.
- **Related:** BL-AUTH-012 (org lock ≠ global lock), BL-AUTH-013 (which code), BL-AUTH-015 (how the org is chosen), BL-B2B-013 (effective status).
- **Source:** `vc-module-customer` `OrganizationIdRequestValidator.cs` `ValidateOrganizationAccessAsync` — `isLocked` and `statusError` are computed independently, the `allowFallback` branch returns `null` (no error) whenever a fallback org resolves, and the terminal `return isLocked ? UserIsLockedInOrganization(...) : statusError` yields a single response; `allowFallback` is set from `GrantType == password` only. Live-confirmed on the environment: the three-state lock/status probe returned exactly one code with the lock code winning and the status code restored on unlock; separately, a blocking-status single-org user with no explicit org signed in successfully with no organization context. Docs axis: N/A — no published guide covers the token endpoint's org fallback or error precedence (waived).
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04; source+live agree, docs waived).

### BL-AUTH-017: A malformed REST request body yields 400, never 500 `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A REST endpoint that accepts a request body MUST validate required fields **before** touching any downstream store or lookup; a missing, null, or unparseable body MUST return **400 Bad Request**, never an unhandled **500**. A well-formed body carrying a merely *wrong* value (an empty-string or unknown username) is a different outcome and MUST still resolve gracefully — typically `200` with a failure flag. No response body may leak a stack trace.
- **Verify:** `POST /api/platform/security/login` with `{}`, `{"userName":null,"password":null}`, a missing `password` key, or an empty raw body → `400`. The same shape with a well-formed but unknown `userName` → `200` + `succeeded:false`. Assert no `stackTrace` in any response.
- **Violation signal:** `500 Internal Server Error` on a malformed or empty request body; a parameter-name leak such as `Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'userName')` surfacing to the caller; or an over-correction that starts rejecting previously-valid payloads with `400`.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Docs:** PlatformDeveloperGuide states the platform-wide convention ("400 Bad Request: Invalid payload (e.g., malformed JSON, invalid JSON-Pointer syntax)") — supporting the general contract, though not specific to this endpoint.
- **Source:** vc-platform `src/VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web/Controllers/Api/SecurityController.cs` — `Login([FromBody] LoginRequest request)` guards `if (request?.UserName == null || request.Password == null) { return BadRequest(); }` before any user lookup. The source evidence is this one endpoint; the Rule generalizes it on the strength of the documented platform-wide convention.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs (general convention) + Source (exact) + Live (`400` observed on an empty body via the platform's own API surface) agree.)

## Domain 6: B2B / Organization (BL-B2B)

### BL-B2B-001: Org switching isolates cart, addresses, and lists `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a B2B user switches between organizations, the cart, saved addresses, wish lists, and pricing context must completely reset to the new organization's scope. No data from the previous org should leak into the new org's context.
- **Verify:** Org A has items in cart → switch to Org B → cart is empty (or shows Org B's cart). Org A's addresses not visible under Org B. Switch back → Org A's cart restored.
- **Violation signal:** Org A's cart items visible under Org B; addresses from wrong org shown; prices from wrong org applied.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (org switcher), qa-backend-expert (xAPI context switching)

### BL-B2B-002: Organization-specific pricing overrides store default `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When an organization has an assigned price list, those prices override the store's default price list for all members of that organization. The priority chain is: organization price list → store default price list → "Unavailable." If the org price list doesn't cover a product, the store default applies as fallback.
- **Verify:** Org A has custom price list (Product X = $50). Store default has Product X = $75. Sign in as Org A member → Product X shows $50. Sign in as non-org user → Product X shows $75. Check a product NOT in org's price list → should show store default price.
- **Violation signal:** Org member sees store default price instead of org price; non-org user sees org prices; product without org price shows "Unavailable" instead of falling back to store default.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (price display), qa-backend-expert (price list resolution API)

### BL-B2B-003: Quote expiry makes quote non-convertible `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Quotes (RFQ) have an expiration date set by the seller. After expiry, the buyer cannot convert the quote to an order — the "Convert to Order" action must be disabled or show an "Expired" message. Expired quotes remain visible in history but are not actionable. The seller can extend or reissue an expired quote.
- **Verify:** Create quote with expiry in 1 hour → wait for expiry → buyer attempts to convert → blocked with "Quote expired" message. Seller re-opens and extends → buyer can now convert.
- **Violation signal:** Expired quote converted to order; no expiry indication shown; "Convert" button active on expired quote; order placed at expired quote prices.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (quotes UI), qa-backend-expert (quotes API)

### BL-B2B-004: Pre-purchase approval is quote-based; no native per-order spending limit `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Virto Commerce has **no** native per-order spending-limit / budget-threshold gate, and **no** auto-approval order status (live-verified 2026-07-15: the settable `Order.Status` set is an admin-editable dictionary (e.g. New, Pending, Payment required, Ready for pickup, Completed, Cancelled, Custom, and Processing — all settable, not a fixed enum; see BL-ORD-009) — there is **no** "Pending approval"). Pre-purchase approval is **quote-based**: a buyer submits a Purchase Request / Quote (`submitQuoteRequest`), which an organization approver accepts or declines (`approveQuoteRequest` / `declineQuoteRequest`) before it can become an order. The `CustomerOrderType.isApproved` boolean is a passive data flag with no workflow or mutation behind it — not a spending-limit gate. Any budget-threshold / delegated-limit enforcement is a **custom or roadmap** capability, not stock platform behavior.
- **Verify:** As an org member, create a Purchase Request / Quote → `submitQuoteRequest` → an org approver `approveQuoteRequest` / `declineQuoteRequest` before it is ordered. Introspect xAPI: order-status enum has **no** `PendingApproval`; there is **no** `approveOrder`/`rejectOrder` mutation and no org/member `limit`/`budget` field.
- **Violation signal:** A test asserts a stock budget-limit order-approval workflow ("Pending approval" order status, per-order spending cap, self-approval block) — this feature does not exist in the base platform and must not be asserted as native. (A custom deployment MAY add one; scope such tests to that deployment.)
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (quote request/approval flow), qa-backend-expert (quote xAPI + order-status enum)

### BL-B2B-005: Member role determines feature visibility `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Organization features visible on the storefront depend on the member's role. Org Admins see: member management, quotes, order approval, lists. Buyers see: order placement (within limits), lists, own orders. Members without purchasing role see: catalog browsing only. Feature visibility is controlled by both role permissions and the store's feature flags (`quotesEnabled`, etc.).
- **Verify:** Sign in as Org Admin → see "Members", "Quotes", "Approval" menu items. Sign in as Buyer → see "Orders", "Lists" but NOT "Members." Sign in as view-only member → no cart, no checkout access.
- **Violation signal:** Buyer sees member management; non-purchasing member can add to cart; features visible when feature flag is OFF; role change not reflected until re-login.
- **Data path (VCST-5028):** Permission-gated features read `pageContext.user.permissions`, which MUST be populated from the **active `OrganizationMembership.Roles`** after an org-switch. The global `ApplicationUser.Roles` is no longer the source of truth for org-scoped visibility. (BUG-A: the org-scoped JWT was correct but the `me`/GetPageContext projection returned `permissions:[]`, hiding maintainer actions — see BL-B2B-007.)
- **Org-level roles (VCST-5239):** beyond per-member `OrganizationMembership.Roles`, an org can carry **org-level roles** (`Organization.Roles`) inherited by **all** its members. Effective perms = the **deduped union** of org-level-role ∪ membership-role ∪ global roles (storefront `getContactRoles` unions org+global). Removing a member's own membership-role override MUST preserve the org-inherited perms (verified — no strip-the-base regression).
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront nav), qa-backend-expert (org roles API)

### BL-B2B-006: White labeling resolution order `[P1-data]` → superseded by Domain 19 (BL-WL)
- **Rule:** White labeling resolution now lives in **Domain 19 (BL-WL-001..006)**. The authoritative behavior: a **store master switch** (`WhiteLabeling.WhiteLabelingEnabled`, store-level public setting, storefront-enforced in `useWhiteLabeling.ts`) gates all WL for the store — when OFF, the storefront applies no branding at all and everyone (incl. org users) sees theme defaults (**BL-WL-003 layer 1** — this validates the original claim's spirit). When ON, org and store WL *records* are merged **per-field** with the org value preferred (**BL-WL-002**), each record filtered by its own `IsEnabled` flag (**BL-WL-003 layer 2** — a disabled/absent store record removes only the store's contribution and does NOT suppress an enabled org record). The current `GetWhiteLabelingSettingsQueryHandler` resolves **organization + store** only — a user-level override is not present in the handler (do not assume it).
- **Verify:** See BL-WL-002 (per-field merge) and BL-WL-003 (store master switch + record-level gating).
- **Violation signal:** Master switch OFF but WL still applied; whole-object override instead of per-field merge; an enabled org's branding suppressed merely by a disabled/absent store *record* (confusing the record flag with the master switch).
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (visual theming, master-switch gate), qa-backend-expert (white labeling xAPI, store settings)
- **Corrected:** 2026-07-02 (TLC-2026-07-02-2043). Refined the original *"user-level override → organization → store default; org overrides only apply when store WL enabled; if disabled all users see store default regardless of org"* into the two-layer model above: the master switch (store setting, storefront-enforced) is real and does suppress org branding; the per-record `IsEnabled` merge (per-field, org-preferred) is the newly-documented xAPI detail. User-level override not found in the current handler.

### BL-B2B-007: Per-org JWT permission set is org-scoped; pageContext must match it `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** A JWT issued for org X MUST carry only the `permission[]` derived from `OrganizationMembership.Roles` for (userId, orgX); permissions from any other org MUST NOT appear. `pageContext.user.permissions` (the `me`/GetPageContext projection) MUST equal the active-org JWT `permission[]`. (VCST-5028.)
- **Org-level role perms in the JWT (VCST-5239):** org-level-role permissions also flow into the org-scoped JWT via `OrganizationIdClaimProvider` (adding an org-level role raised a member's token 11→12 perms). The union (org-level ∪ membership ∪ global) stays strictly org-scoped — no cross-org leak — and `pageContext.user.permissions` still equals the decoded JWT for the active org.
- **Verify:** User is org-maintainer in X, org-employee in Y. Switch to X → decode JWT → maintainer set present, employee-only set absent. Switch to Y → only employee set. For each org, `GetPageContext` → `user.permissions` matches the decoded JWT for that org.
- **Violation signal:** JWT carries another org's permissions; `pageContext.user.permissions` diverges from the JWT (BUG-A condition — pageContext returned `[]` while the JWT held 8 maintainer perms).
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (org switcher, pageContext), qa-backend-expert (token minting, xAPI me resolver)

### BL-B2B-008: Org-scoped role change mutates only the target org's membership `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Changing a member's role in org X (`changeOrganizationContactRole(memberId, roleIds)` or REST `PUT /api/customer/organization-memberships/{id}`) MUST update only the (userId, orgX) `OrganizationMembership.Roles`. Other orgs' membership records and the global `ApplicationUser.Roles` MUST be unchanged. (VCST-5028 — guards against the old handler that replaced global roles.)
- **Org-level role / whitelist scope (VCST-5239):** assigning an **org-level** role or changing an org's role **whitelist** settings mutates only that org — other orgs' memberships, their whitelist settings, and the global `ApplicationUser.Roles` are untouched (verified TechFlow↔BuildRight).
- **Verify:** Member is employee in X, manager in Y. Change X → manager. `POST /api/customer/organization-memberships/search {userId}` → X role = manager, Y role still manager. `GET /api/platform/security/users/{userId}` → global `roles[]` unchanged.
- **Violation signal:** Role change in X also alters Y's membership or the global account roles.

### BL-B2B-009: Inviting a member creates a per-org membership, not a global role `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Inviting a user into org X with a role MUST create an `OrganizationMembership` for (newUserId, orgX) with that role; the global `ApplicationUser.Roles` MUST NOT be modified. After acceptance, `GET /api/customer/organization-memberships/user/{userId}/count` ≥ 1. (VCST-5028.)
- **Verify:** Invite a new user into X as employee; after acceptance, `POST /search {userId}` → contains org X with role employee. `GET /api/platform/security/users/{userId}` → global `roles[]` empty / no org-specific role.
- **Violation signal:** No membership record after invite acceptance; the invite writes a global role instead.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (invite + membership API), qa-frontend-expert (invite flow)

### BL-B2B-010: Self-service company registration grants org-membership roles only, never global roles `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Self-service company registration (storefront `/sign-up`, "Organization" account type) MUST create the `Organization`, the registrant `Contact`, and an `OrganizationMembership` for (newUserId, newOrg) carrying the registrant's org role(s) (e.g. org-maintainer); the registration flow MUST NOT write any platform security role to the global `ApplicationUser.Roles`. This is the registration-time counterpart of BL-B2B-009 (which covers the invite path). (VCST-5028.)
- **Verify:** Register a new company with a fresh `AGENT-TEST-` user. `POST /api/customer/organization-memberships/search {userEmail}` → membership exists with non-empty org role(s) and `isActive=true`. `GET /api/platform/security/users/{userId}` → global `roles[]` empty / contains no platform admin role. The two assertions together prove roles live in the membership record, not on the global account.
- **Violation signal:** After registration the global `ApplicationUser.Roles` is non-empty with platform roles; or no membership/org role is created for the new organization.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (registration flow), qa-backend-expert (members + organization-memberships + security/users API)

### BL-B2B-011: Org role whitelist scopes assignable roles; enforcement is a planned server-side gate `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Two dictionary platform settings — `Customer.OrganizationRolesWhitelist` and `Customer.MembershipRolesWhitelist`
  (`ValueType=ShortText`, `IsDictionary=true`; content lives in `allowedValues`, never `value`) — each hold a SELECTED
  subset of the live platform roles list (`GET /api/platform/security/roles/search`), never free-text. The Organization
  whitelist filters the org-level "Change roles" picker in Admin SPA (org-record `Organization.Roles`, `PUT /api/organizations`);
  the Membership whitelist filters the per-member role editor in the Organization memberships widget
  (`OrganizationMembership.Roles`, `changeOrganizationContactRole` / `PUT /api/customer/organization-memberships/{id}`).
  Each picker's option set = (assignable roles ∩ its own whitelist) − roles already assigned to that org/membership —
  the two whitelists are independent settings and must never cross-contaminate each other's picker. An EMPTY whitelist
  means **NO restriction — the picker offers ALL platform roles** (source-grounded: `vc-module-customer`
  `Scripts/services/rolesPickerService.js` applies the whitelist filter *only* inside `if (whitelist.length) { … }`, so an
  empty `allowedValues` skips filtering; the org-level picker and the per-member editor share this one service).
  "Empty = allow-all", NOT lock-out, is the **intended design** — confirmed at source + live 2026-07-15 during VCST-5441
  (corrects the earlier assumption that empty must lock out to zero options). **Server-side
  enforcement of the whitelist is a planned gate, not yet implemented** (VCST-5239 Story EPIC-5239-03): as of 2026-07,
  `PUT /api/organizations` and `changeOrganizationContactRole` accept a non-whitelisted `roleId` with no rejection
  (backend finding F1 — zero whitelist references in `profile-experience-api#137` or the REST organizations endpoint) —
  the whitelist today constrains only the Admin UI picker's *offered* options, not what the API will *accept*.
- **Verify:** Remove a currently-visible role from a NON-EMPTY whitelist → cache-reset + reload → picker no longer offers it.
  Empty whitelist → picker shows **ALL** platform roles (filter skipped) — this is correct, NOT a fallback bug. Add-direction
  persists round-trip after reload; clear-to-empty **persists** after reload as of Platform 3.1044.0 / vc-platform PR #3076
  (VCST-5441 fixed 2026-07-15; previously silently reverted). Direct PUT/GraphQL bypass with a non-whitelisted role currently
  succeeds — expected-post-fix it must be rejected (`errors[]` non-empty) without blocking a whitelisted role on the same path.
- **Violation signal:** With a NON-EMPTY whitelist, the picker offers a role outside it after a genuine cache-reset+reload,
  OR fails to narrow to the whitelist's entries; an EMPTY whitelist wrongly locks out / shows zero options (empty must show
  ALL roles — the filter is skipped by design); one whitelist's picker reflects the other whitelist's roles; clear-to-empty
  silently reverts (the pre-fix VCST-5441 signature — a re-appearance now means PR #3076 regressed); once server enforcement
  ships — a non-whitelisted role is accepted by the API, OR a whitelisted role is rejected (over-blocking).

- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA picker, REST/GraphQL enforcement)

### BL-B2B-012: Declining or revoking an invite changes a status — it never deletes the membership row `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The membership lifecycle is **status transitions on a persistent row**, not row creation/deletion:
  - Declining an invitation (`rejectOrganizationInvite`) sets `OrganizationMembership.Status = "Rejected"`. The **row survives**, the contact **keeps** its association with the organization, and the member remains listed in the organization's member list. `Rejected` is a blocking status, so access is refused (BL-AUTH-013) — the user is blocked, not detached.
  - Revoking a pending invite likewise sets `Status = "Deleted"`. **`Deleted` is a status value, not a row deletion** — the row is still returned by a membership search.
  - **Re-invite is gated on `ReinvitableStatuses` = {`Rejected`, `Deleted`} only.** So a declined or revoked member CAN be invited again, while an **already-`Invited`** (still pending) membership CANNOT — re-inviting it fails as already-a-member; it can only be *resent*. `Approved` is likewise not re-invitable.
- **Verify:** Decline an invitation → membership search still returns the row with `Status = "Rejected"`; the contact's organization list still contains that organization; the member is still listed in the organization's member list (surfaced under an inactive-style label, not removed). Re-invite the same user into the same organization → succeeds. Repeat against a membership at `Invited` → rejected as already-a-member. A test asserting a member is *gone* must check the **row's absence**, not a `Deleted` status; teardown must delete the row.
- **Violation signal:** Declining removes the membership row or strips the contact's organization association (a later re-invite then has nothing to reactivate, and a "still a member?" assertion silently inverts); a `Deleted` status is treated as row removal by a search consumer; re-invite succeeds against an `Invited` membership (duplicating the pending invite) or fails against a `Rejected`/`Deleted` one (declining becomes irreversible).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (invite/reject membership APIs, membership search), qa-frontend-expert (member list, pending invites)
- **Related:** BL-B2B-009 (invite creates a per-org membership, not a global role), BL-AUTH-013 (the per-status refusal code), BL-B2B-013 (effective status).
- **Source:** `vc-module-profile-experience-api` `RejectOrganizationInviteCommandHandler.Handle` (a single `SetStatusAsync(..., Rejected)` — no row delete, no mutation of the contact's organizations) + `vc-module-customer` `InviteCustomerService` `RevokeInviteAsync` (`SetStatusAsync(..., Deleted)`), `InviteExistingUserToOrganization` (the `ReinvitableStatuses.Contains(...)` gate, else already-a-member) and `ModuleConstants.MembershipStatuses` (`BlockingStatuses` = {Invited, Rejected, Deleted}; `ReinvitableStatuses` = {Rejected, Deleted}). Live-confirmed on the environment: memberships at rest at `Rejected` and at `Deleted` are both still present in the organization's member list (rendered under an inactive label) and their users still resolve as associated contacts. The **mutation** half is now **live-confirmed** (2026-08-25): a membership created at `Invited` and rejected by the invitee resolved to `Rejected` on an authoritative admin re-read, with the row still present. Note the mutation's own **response payload** reports the stale pre-write value (`Approved`, the BL-B2B-013 default) — the write is correct, the returned projection is not; tracked separately as a response-shape defect. Docs axis: N/A — the published storefront guide documents inviting and block/unblock/delete of members but has no accept/decline-invitation surface at all, and names no status vocabulary (waived).
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04; source+live agree, docs waived).

### BL-B2B-013: Membership status resolves per-org-first, then contact, then `Approved` `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A membership's **effective status** is resolved by a three-tier fallback — `ResolveEffectiveStatus(membershipStatus, memberStatus)`:
  1. the **membership's own** `Status`, if set — a per-organization override that **wins over the contact's status**;
  2. else the **contact's** `Status` — inherited, which is what a membership row with a null status does;
  3. else **`Approved`**.

  So `Approved` is the effective default, and a **null** membership status is a **legacy/inheritance** shape (rows predating the status field, or rows deliberately left to inherit) — not a distinct fourth state. The legal manually-selectable set is exactly four values — `Invited`, `Approved`, `Rejected`, `Deleted` — carried by the `Customer.OrganizationMembershipStatuses` dictionary setting whose default is `Approved`; because it is a dictionary, a fifth value observed on an environment is **admin-added environment data, not the contract**.
  **Status is a separate axis from lock.** `IsLocked`/`LockoutEnd` → `IsCurrentlyLocked` is not a status value and never appears in the status set; a UI may render both on one column, but the two must be assertable independently (BL-AUTH-016 defines their precedence when both apply).
- **Verify:** Set a membership's `Status` to a blocking value while the **contact's** status stays `Approved` → the effective status is the membership's (access is refused per BL-AUTH-013), proving tier 1 beats tier 2. Clear the membership's `Status` → the effective status follows the contact's. Read `Customer.OrganizationMembershipStatuses` → default `Approved`, allowed values the four-value set. Lock a membership whose status is `Approved` → refused on the lock axis with the status untouched.
- **Violation signal:** A contact-level status overrides an explicit membership status (tiers inverted — a per-org block silently ignored, or a healthy org blocked by an unrelated contact status); a null membership status is treated as blocking (or as a fifth state) instead of inheriting; a lock is written into the `Status` field, or a status value is used to express a lock, collapsing the two axes so one cannot be cleared without the other.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (memberships REST/GraphQL, platform settings), qa-frontend-expert (member list status rendering)
- **Related:** BL-AUTH-013 (per-status refusal codes), BL-AUTH-015 (accessibility predicate), BL-AUTH-016 (lock-vs-status precedence), BL-B2B-012 (lifecycle transitions).
- **Source:** `vc-module-customer` `OrganizationMembership.ResolveEffectiveStatus` (the three tiers) and `IsCurrentlyLocked` (the separate lock axis) + `ModuleConstants.MembershipStatuses` (`ManuallySelectableStatuses` / `BlockingStatuses` / `ReinvitableStatuses`) and the `OrganizationMembershipStatuses` setting descriptor (`IsDictionary = true`, `DefaultValue = Approved`, `AllowedValues = ManuallySelectableStatuses`). Live-confirmed on the environment: a membership at `Rejected` whose contact was `Approved` resolved to the membership's value (the org was excluded from access), i.e. tier 1 beats tier 2; and the member list rendered the lock axis as its own label distinct from every status label. Tiers 2 and 3 (inherit-from-contact, and the terminal `Approved`) are **source-only this run**. Docs axis: N/A — the published guide documents that Customer statuses are configurable dictionaries but names no membership-status value, default, or resolution order (waived).

## Domain 7: Catalog & Inventory (BL-CAT)

### BL-CAT-001: Stock zero disables purchase `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a product's aggregated stock across all fulfillment centers reaches 0, the storefront must show "Sold out" (or equivalent), and the "Add to Cart" button must be disabled. The product remains visible but non-purchasable.
- **Verify:** Set stock to 0 in Admin → storefront shows "Sold out" label → "Add to Cart" disabled/hidden → attempt via xAPI `addToCart` → error response.
- **Violation signal:** "Add to Cart" still active when stock=0; product purchasable via API despite zero stock; no visual indicator of out-of-stock.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (PDP, listing), qa-backend-expert (inventory API, xAPI)

### BL-CAT-002: Virtual catalog inherits physical catalog changes `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A virtual catalog is a view over physical catalog data — not a copy. Any change to a product in the physical catalog (price, description, stock, images) is immediately reflected in all virtual catalogs that include it. There is no manual sync or publish step for catalog data propagation. Deletion of a product from the physical catalog removes it from all linked virtual catalogs.
- **Verify:** Edit product name in physical catalog → open virtual catalog → name updated immediately. Delete product from physical catalog → virtual catalog no longer shows it. Add product to physical catalog in a linked category → appears in virtual catalog.
- **Violation signal:** Virtual catalog shows stale data after physical catalog edit; deleted product still appears in virtual catalog; changes require manual sync.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (catalog API, Admin SPA)

### BL-CAT-003: Search index lag window `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** After an admin change (product create/update/delete, price change, stock update), there is a 30-60 second window where the Elasticsearch index still reflects old data. During this window, storefront search/listing may show stale results. However, PDP (direct product page) and cart always use live data. After reindex, search results must match the current state.
- **Verify:** Change product name in Admin → immediately search on storefront → may show old name (acceptable within 60s). Wait 60s → search shows new name. Direct product URL shows new name immediately (not from search index).
- **Violation signal:** Stale data persists beyond 120s (2 reindex cycles); PDP shows stale data (should be live); reindex doesn't resolve the discrepancy.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (search + PDP), qa-backend-expert (search index API)

### BL-CAT-004: Category visibility toggle `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Setting a category to "invisible" (visible=false) in Admin hides it from storefront navigation menus and category pages. However, products within a hidden category remain accessible via direct URL, search, and other categories they belong to. Subcategories of a hidden category also become hidden from navigation.
- **Verify:** Hide category in Admin → storefront menu no longer shows it → products still accessible via search or direct URL → subcategories also hidden from nav. Unhide → category and subcategories return to nav.
- **Violation signal:** Hidden category still in navigation menu; products in hidden category inaccessible via direct URL; subcategories still visible when parent is hidden.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront nav), qa-backend-expert (category API)

### BL-CAT-005: Product requires virtual catalog assignment for storefront `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A product that exists only in a physical catalog (not linked to any virtual catalog assigned to a store) will NOT appear on the storefront. The storefront reads from the single catalog assigned to the store, which may be a physical catalog directly or a virtual catalog built over one or more physical catalogs. Products must be in a category within the store's assigned catalog (or its linked physical catalog) to be visible.
- **Verify:** Create product in physical catalog only (not in store's virtual catalog) → storefront search returns nothing → add to virtual catalog category → product appears on storefront.
- **Violation signal:** Product visible on storefront without virtual catalog assignment; product appears in wrong store's catalog; physical-only product accessible via search.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (catalog API), qa-frontend-expert (storefront search)

### BL-CAT-006: Configurable product requires all sections filled `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** A configurable product (product with required configuration sections/options) cannot be added to cart until all required configuration sections are completed by the customer. The "Add to Cart" button must remain disabled until every required section has a selection. Optional sections may be left empty.
- **Verify:** Open configurable product → "Add to Cart" disabled → fill first required section → still disabled (more sections required) → fill all required sections → "Add to Cart" enabled. Leave an optional section empty → still enabled.
- **Violation signal:** "Add to Cart" enabled with incomplete required sections; configurable product added without configuration; configuration selections not reflected in cart line item.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (PDP configuration UI), qa-backend-expert (addToCart validation)

### BL-CAT-007: Multi-FFC inventory aggregation `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A product's available stock on the storefront equals the sum of inventory across all fulfillment centers (FFCs) assigned to the store. If FFC-A has 10 units and FFC-B has 5 units, the storefront shows 15 available. Stock is decremented from the appropriate FFC based on fulfillment logic (closest to shipping address or priority order).
- **Verify:** Set FFC-A = 10, FFC-B = 5 → storefront shows "In stock" with effective availability of 15. Place order for 12 → FFC-A decremented first (allocation logic). Check remaining: FFC-A + FFC-B totals correct.
- **Violation signal:** Storefront shows stock from only one FFC; total doesn't match sum; decrement applied to wrong FFC; stock goes negative in one FFC while another has units.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (inventory API, FFC management), qa-frontend-expert (stock display)

### BL-CAT-008: Unit-of-measure CRUD integrity `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Creating, renaming, or deleting a unit-of-measure group or unit in the Catalog module persists atomically and leaves no orphaned data. Deleting a group removes its units; a deleted group/unit no longer appears in the list or in product UoM dropdowns; group integrity is preserved after a unit delete.
- **Verify:** Create UoM group → appears in list (`POST /api/catalog/measures/search`); rename → list reflects new name; delete group → group and its units absent (`DELETE /api/catalog/measures?ids=…`; verify via `GET /api/catalog/measures/{id}`). Create unit in group → appears with name/short-name/conversion-factor; edit → persists; delete unit → removed, group intact (`GET /api/catalog/measures/{id}`). Note: units are **nested inside** the Measure (group) entity and saved via the group (`POST`/`PUT /api/catalog/measures`, partial `PATCH /api/catalog/measures/{id}`) — there is no separate unit endpoint.
- **Violation signal:** Group/unit not created; edit not persisted; delete leaves orphaned units or stale API data; group integrity broken after a unit deletion.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA + REST `/api/catalog/measures`; permissions `Measures*`)

### BL-CAT-009: Category CRUD & cascade-delete integrity `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Creating, editing, or deleting a category persists atomically. Required fields (Name, Code) are enforced on create. Deleting a category **cascades** to its subcategories and its descriptions, and unassigns (does not orphan) products per cascade rules. A cancelled delete makes no change.
- **Verify:** Create category → appears in tree + `GET /api/catalog/categories`. Edit name → persists. Delete-confirm removes it + subcategories (`GET …/{subId}` → 404) + descriptions; Delete-cancel leaves it intact.
- **Violation signal:** Required-field validation bypassed; category not in tree after save; subcategories/descriptions orphaned after delete; category deleted despite Cancel.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Catalog API, Admin SPA)

### BL-CAT-010: Catalog link-permission enforcement (RBAC) `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Linking a whole **category** into another category/catalog requires the `catalog:categories:link` permission; linking a **product/variation** requires `catalog:products:link`. Enforcement is **server-side** on `POST /api/catalog/listentrylinks` (403 without the permission) **and** reflected in the Admin mapping picker (category rows non-selectable without `categories:link`; product/item rows follow `products:link`). With full permissions both remain selectable (backward-compatible default).
- **Verify:** Full-perm user → mapping picker shows category + item checkboxes. Role minus `categories:link` → category rows non-selectable, product rows still selectable; `POST /api/catalog/listentrylinks` with a category entry → 403, with a product entry → 2xx. Both permissions registered with human-readable descriptions (`GET /api/platform/security/permissions`).
- **Violation signal:** Categories selectable / category link created despite missing `categories:link` (server enforcement absent); product link blocked when `products:link` retained (over-restriction); permission renders a raw i18n key instead of a description.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (CatalogModuleListEntryController, Admin SPA mapping picker, security permissions)

### BL-CAT-011: Cross-catalog move cascades CatalogId to owned entities, not linked `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Moving a category **across** physical catalogs cascades the destination `CatalogId` to every **owned** descendant category and **owned** product in the moved subtree. An **intra-catalog** move leaves `CatalogId` unchanged (no spurious cascade). A **linked (non-owned)** product referenced by the moved subtree is never rewritten, relocated, duplicated, or deleted.
- **Verify:** Cross-catalog move → parent + child + owned products report the destination `CatalogId` (`GET …/categories|products/{id}`; `POST /api/catalog/listentries/move`). Intra-catalog move → `CatalogId` unchanged. Linked foreign-catalog product → `CatalogId` stays its owner catalog.
- **Violation signal:** Descendant/product retains source `CatalogId` after move → mis-indexed/orphaned; intra-catalog move changes `CatalogId` (over-eager cascade); linked non-owned product rewritten to the destination catalog.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (`POST /api/catalog/listentries/move`, catalog API)

### BL-CAT-012: Category dictionary-value & metadata management `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Adding or removing a category **tax-type dictionary value**, **SEO** record (store-scoped), **image**, or **localized description** persists to the category and is **scoped to the value acted on** — deleting one dictionary value must not remove other shared values. SEO/description changes render on the storefront, respecting locale.
- **Verify:** Add a tax-type value → in dropdown + `GET …/{id}`. Delete a self-created value → only that value gone, shared values intact. Add SEO/image/description → persists + renders on the storefront for the correct locale.
- **Violation signal:** Save fails silently; a shared/pre-existing dictionary value deleted instead of the target; SEO/description not rendered on storefront; localized description shown under the wrong locale.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Catalog API, Admin SPA), qa-frontend-expert (storefront SEO/description render)

## Domain 8: Cross-Domain Invariants (BL-CROSS)

These invariants span multiple modules and are where the most expensive production bugs hide. Agents should prioritize these during regression testing.

### BL-CROSS-001: Price list deletion → storefront unavailability `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a price list is deleted in Admin, affected products on the storefront must show as "Unavailable" (not $0). The "Add to Cart" button must be disabled. Products without any active price list in the current currency cannot be purchased.
- **Verify:** Delete price list in Admin → storefront product shows "Unavailable" or equivalent, not "$0.00" → "Add to Cart" disabled → xAPI `products` query returns `price: null` or empty price object.
- **Violation signal:** Product displays "$0.00" price after price list deletion; "Add to Cart" remains active; order can be placed for $0.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (pricing API, Admin), qa-frontend-expert (storefront display), qa-testing-expert (end-to-end)

### BL-CROSS-002: Catalog change → search lag → cart price mismatch window `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** After a product price or availability is changed in Admin, there is a 30-60 second window where the Elasticsearch index still reflects old data. During this window, the storefront may show stale prices. However, the cart/checkout must always use the server-side (current) price — not the cached search index price.
- **Verify:** Change price in Admin → immediately check storefront listing (may show old price) → add to cart → cart must show the NEW price. After reindex → listing matches cart.
- **Violation signal:** Cart uses stale price from search index; order placed at old price after admin price increase; price mismatch between listing and cart persists beyond reindex window.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (price display), qa-backend-expert (search index, pricing), qa-testing-expert (timing scenario)

### BL-CROSS-003: Module disable → API 404, Admin section removal, dependent degradation `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When a module is disabled in Admin, its REST APIs return 404, its Admin SPA sections disappear, and its GraphQL schema types are removed. Dependent modules should degrade gracefully — not crash.
- **Verify:** Disable module → its API endpoints return 404 → Admin menu item gone → dependent module shows appropriate fallback (not error screen) → re-enable → everything restored.
- **Violation signal:** API returns 500 instead of 404; Admin section still visible but broken; dependent module crashes; re-enable doesn't restore functionality.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (API, Admin), qa-frontend-expert (storefront degradation)

### BL-CROSS-004: Currency switch triggers multi-system recalculation `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a user switches currency on the storefront, the following must all update atomically: (1) product prices switch to the new currency's price list, (2) cart line items recalculate using new prices, (3) shipping rates update for the new currency, (4) tax recalculates if rates differ. Products without prices in the new currency become unavailable.
- **Verify:** Switch currency → all prices update → cart totals recalculate → shipping and tax adjust → products without new-currency prices show "Unavailable".
- **Violation signal:** Partial update (prices change but cart doesn't recalculate); shipping in old currency; tax on pre-switch amounts; mixed currency display.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (full UI flow), qa-backend-expert (xAPI response)

### BL-CROSS-005: Order placement triggers multi-system side effects `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When an order is successfully placed, the following side effects must all occur: (1) inventory decremented by ordered quantities, (2) order confirmation email sent to the customer, (3) GA4 `purchase` event fired with correct order ID, revenue, and items, (4) order appears in the customer's order history, (5) cart is cleared. All side effects must complete — partial execution (e.g., inventory decremented but email not sent) is a bug.
- **Verify:** Place order → check inventory (decremented) → check email inbox (confirmation received) → check GA4 dataLayer (purchase event with correct data) → check "My Orders" (order listed) → check cart (empty). Verify in Admin: order exists with correct totals.
- **Violation signal:** Inventory not decremented; email not sent; GA4 event missing or wrong revenue; order not in history; cart not cleared; any side effect missing.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (confirmation + GA4), qa-backend-expert (inventory + order API), qa-testing-expert (email + end-to-end)

### BL-CROSS-006: Feature flag toggle → immediate behavior change `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Store-level feature flags (e.g., `quotesEnabled`, `anonymousUsersAllowed`, `createAnonymousOrderEnabled`) take effect on the storefront without requiring a restart or redeployment. The storefront reads flags from xAPI on each page load. Module-level flags (e.g., module enable/disable) may require a platform restart. The distinction must be documented per flag.
- **Verify:** Toggle `quotesEnabled` OFF in Admin → refresh storefront → "Request Quote" button disappears. Toggle ON → button returns. For module flags: disable module → restart platform → verify effects.
- **Violation signal:** Flag change requires restart when it shouldn't; flag change has no effect until cache expires; storefront caches flags beyond one page load.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront UI), qa-backend-expert (store settings API)

### BL-CROSS-007: Admin entity deletion → cascade cleanup `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When a top-level entity is deleted in Admin, all dependent data must be cleaned up: (1) delete catalog → products, categories, prices, search index entries removed; (2) delete organization → members disassociated (not deleted), org-specific price lists unlinked; (3) delete store → associated virtual catalog unlinked, orders preserved (historical). No orphaned records should remain in the database.
- **Verify:** Delete a catalog → its products no longer appear in search, pricing, or any virtual catalog. Delete an org → members can still log in but have no org association. Check xAPI: no references to deleted entities.
- **Violation signal:** Orphaned products in search after catalog deletion; orphaned prices referencing deleted products; member accounts deleted with org; API returns references to deleted entities.

### BL-CROSS-008: Organization switch → full context swap `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a B2B user switches organization, ALL of the following must swap atomically: (1) cart — new org's cart loads, (2) addresses — new org's address book, (3) pricing — new org's price list, (4) lists/wish lists — new org's lists, (5) white labeling — new org's theme (if WL enabled), (6) quotes — new org's quotes. Partial swap (e.g., cart changes but prices don't) is a critical bug.
- **Verify:** As Org A, note cart, addresses, prices, theme → switch to Org B → verify ALL six contexts changed → switch back → ALL restored to Org A's state.
- **Violation signal:** Cart swaps but prices remain from previous org; addresses from wrong org; theme doesn't change; partial context swap of any kind.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (full UI), qa-backend-expert (xAPI org context)

### BL-CROSS-009: Eventual consistency is bounded `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Any change to an entity — an admin edit (product, price, inventory, category, settings) **or a write through any API surface** (REST, xAPI/GraphQL) — must be reflected everywhere that entity is read within 120 seconds (2 reindex cycles). This bound covers search index, cache layers, CDN, **and per-entity read caches**: a write on one surface must invalidate the cached read of the *same* entity on every other surface — caches must expire on the entity's change event, not only on a same-surface write. After 120 seconds, any discrepancy (Admin vs storefront, or one API surface vs another) is a bug.
- **Verify:** (a) Make an admin change → start timer → check storefront repeatedly → reflects within 120s; if using CDN, verify cache purge within the same window. (b) Cross-surface: write an entity via one API (e.g. a REST cart change) → read the *same* entity via another API (e.g. a GraphQL cart query) → the read reflects the write, because the change event invalidated the read cache.
- **Violation signal:** Storefront shows stale data after 120s; change requires manual cache purge; inconsistency between search results and product detail pages; a read on one API surface returns stale data after a write on another surface (read cache not invalidated on the change event).
- **Agents:** qa-testing-expert (timing scenario), qa-frontend-expert (storefront), qa-backend-expert (search index; cross-surface API read-cache consistency)
- **Amended:** 2026-07-23 (generalized to cross-API-surface read-cache invalidation on the entity change event. Verified live: a REST cart write is reflected by a subsequent xAPI cart read once the cart-changed event expires the aggregate read cache. 3-source: {OBSERVED} live GREEN + source (a cart-changed event handler that expires the per-cart cache token) + fix ticket VCST-5505.)

### BL-CROSS-010: Idempotency on all checkout mutations `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** All checkout-related mutations (addToCart, removeFromCart, placeOrder, processPayment) must be idempotent when retried with the same idempotency key or cart token. Network retries, browser refreshes, and double-clicks must never produce duplicate side effects (double charges, double orders, double inventory decrement).
- **Verify:** Call `placeOrder` twice with same cart token → only 1 order created, 1 inventory decrement, 1 payment charge. Simulate network timeout + retry → same result. Refresh the confirmation page → no new order.
- **Violation signal:** Duplicate orders on retry; double payment charge; inventory decremented twice; different results on identical retry.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (order/payment API), qa-testing-expert (retry scenarios)

### BL-CROSS-011: Graceful degradation when dependent service is down `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When a dependent service is unavailable (Elasticsearch down, payment gateway timeout, email service failure, analytics endpoint unreachable), the platform must degrade gracefully: (1) search down → show "Search unavailable" message, catalog browsing via categories still works; (2) payment gateway down → show error at checkout, don't create orphan orders; (3) email down → order still placed, email queued for retry; (4) analytics down → order still placed, events lost (acceptable).
- **Verify:** Simulate each service outage → verify core flow continues or shows meaningful error → no 500 errors, no white screens, no data corruption.
- **Violation signal:** White screen / 500 error when a dependent service is down; orphan orders created when payment fails; order blocked because email service is down; silent data loss without logging.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (API resilience), qa-testing-expert (fault injection), qa-frontend-expert (error UX)

### BL-CROSS-012: Admin entity deletion never creates $0 products `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** No admin action (price list deletion, catalog reorganization, module disable, currency removal) should ever cause a product with **missing/absent** price data to silently fall back to a purchasable $0.00 on the storefront. The safe state for a product without a valid price is "Unavailable" / "Add to Cart disabled" — never $0.00 with an active purchase button. **EXCEPTION:** an *intentional* $0 price is purchasable by design only when the store's `zero_price_product_enabled` theme flag is TRUE (default FALSE); with the flag FALSE, $0-priced products are not addable to cart. When auditing, confirm the flag state before treating a $0 purchase as a violation.
- **Verify:** Delete price list → check affected products show "Unavailable" not $0. Remove currency → products in that currency become unavailable. Disable pricing module → all products become unpurchasable.
- **Violation signal:** Any product purchasable at $0.00 due to admin action; "Add to Cart" active when price data is missing; order placed at $0.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront), qa-backend-expert (pricing API), qa-testing-expert (end-to-end)

## Domain 9: Search (BL-SRCH)

### BL-SRCH-001: Facet counts match filtered results `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Facet counts displayed alongside filter options (brand, category, price range) must exactly match the number of products returned when that filter is applied. After applying filter "Brand: X (15)", exactly 15 products must appear in the filtered listing. Facet counts must update after each filter is applied (cascading facets).
- **Verify:** Note facet count for Brand X = 15 → click filter → verify exactly 15 products listed. Apply a second filter (e.g., price range) → facet counts for all other facets update to reflect the combined filter.
- **Violation signal:** Facet shows 15 but filter returns 12 products; facet counts don't update after second filter; total count mismatches; empty facets still shown (count > 0 but no results).
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (catalog page), qa-backend-expert (xCatalog facet API)
- **Source:** vc-module-x-catalog `ChildCategoriesQueryHandler` — server-side `TermFacetResult` term counts (`term_facets.terms.count`).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-SRCH-002: Zero-result query shows an intact empty state `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** When a search query returns zero results, the search-results page (rendered by `category.vue` → `category-products.vue`) must render an intact empty state and never a blank grid, broken layout, or error. It must display (1) a clear no-results message via a `VcEmptyView` (variant `search`, icon `outline-stock`) using i18n key `pages.catalog.no_products_filtered_message` when a keyword/filters are active (else `pages.catalog.no_products_message`), with the searched term echoed in the page heading via i18n key `pages.search.header_empty`; and (2) a recovery action — a reset button (i18n key `pages.catalog.no_products_button`) that clears the keyword/filters (emits `resetFilterKeyword`). NOTE: vc-frontend does **NOT** implement spelling "Did you mean…" suggestions nor a popular-products/categories fallback — do not assert them.
- **Verify:** Search for a nonsense term → the `VcEmptyView` no-results message shows with the term echoed in the heading → page layout intact → the reset button is present and clears the keyword/filters. (Do not assert a "Did you mean…" suggestion — it does not exist.)
- **Violation signal:** Blank product grid; broken layout on zero results; no `VcEmptyView`/message on zero results; error/500 on uncommon search terms.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (search results page), ui-ux-expert (UX evaluation)
- **Source:** vc-frontend `vc-empty-view.vue` (`VcEmptyViewVariantType "search"`); RESET SEARCH clears keyword/filters. Live zero-result state confirmed intact.
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-SRCH-003: Search index consistency after catalog change `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** After a product is created, updated, or deleted in Admin, the search index must reflect the change within the consistency window (BL-CROSS-009: 120s). Specifically: new product appears in search, updated product name/description changes in results, deleted product disappears from search. No ghost results for deleted products.
- **Verify:** Create product → wait 120s → search by name → found. Update name → wait 120s → search by new name → found, old name → not found. Delete product → wait 120s → search → not found.
- **Violation signal:** New product not findable after 120s; deleted product still in search results; updated fields not reflected in search; ghost/phantom results.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (search index API, Admin), qa-frontend-expert (storefront search)

### BL-SRCH-004: Search respects store and catalog scope `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Search results are scoped to the current store's virtual catalog. Products from other stores or unlinked physical catalogs must never appear in search results. The search API requires `storeId` context — omitting it is an API contract violation.
- **Verify:** Search on Store A → only products from Store A's virtual catalog appear. Product in Store B's catalog → not in Store A's search. xAPI query without `storeId` → error, not unscoped results.
- **Violation signal:** Products from wrong store in search results; unscoped search returns cross-store data; xAPI returns results without storeId context.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (xCatalog API), qa-frontend-expert (storefront search)

### BL-SRCH-005: Special characters in search queries `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Search must handle special characters safely: quotes, ampersands, angle brackets, Unicode, emoji, and SQL/NoSQL injection patterns. Special characters should be escaped or treated as literal text — never interpreted as query operators (unless explicitly supported like `"exact phrase"` search). No 500 errors, no information leakage.
- **Verify:** Search for `<script>alert(1)</script>` → no XSS, shows "No results." Search for `'; DROP TABLE--` → no error, shows "No results." Search for product with `&` in name → found correctly.
- **Violation signal:** 500 error on special characters; XSS executes; search syntax injection; product with special chars in name not findable.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (search UI), qa-backend-expert (search API), qa-testing-expert (security scenarios)

## Domain 10: Shipping & BOPIS (BL-SHIP)

### BL-SHIP-001: Ship-to address determines available methods `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Available shipping methods and rates are driven by the shipping (delivery) address, never the billing address: the platform asks every active shipping method for a rate, passing it the delivery-address-bearing shipment. VC's out-of-box **Fixed Rate** method returns flat Ground/Air rates that do **NOT** vary by destination — there are **no built-in shipping zones**. Destination-/zone-dependent availability or rates require a **custom shipping provider** registered via the module's extensibility point. Where such a provider is configured, changing the shipping address must refresh the available methods and their rates.
- **Verify:** Confirm options derive from the delivery address, not billing. Default install (Fixed Rate): Ground/Air appear at their configured flat rates regardless of destination. Store with a zone/address-aware provider: changing to an out-of-zone address removes uncovered methods and updates rates; an uncovered zone blocks checkout with a message.
- **Violation signal:** Billing address used instead of shipping to compute methods/rates; a zone-aware provider's methods/rates don't change when the delivery address changes; methods shown for an uncovered zone; rates don't update for a new destination on a zone-aware provider.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout shipping step), qa-backend-expert (shipping API)
- **Source:** vc-module-shipping `FixedRateShippingMethod.CalculateRates` — flat Ground/Air rates from settings, independent of the shipping context destination (no built-in zones).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-SHIP-002: BOPIS requires store pickup location `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Buy Online, Pick Up In Store (BOPIS) is only available when at least one fulfillment center is configured for store pickup in the customer's area. The customer must select a specific pickup location during checkout. BOPIS orders skip the shipping address step but still require a billing address.
- **Verify:** Select BOPIS → prompted to choose pickup location from list → no shipping address form shown → billing address still required → order placed with pickup location in order details.
- **Violation signal:** BOPIS shown when no pickup locations exist; shipping address required for BOPIS; no pickup location selection; order lacks pickup location reference.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout BOPIS flow), qa-backend-expert (fulfillment center API)

### BL-SHIP-003: Free shipping threshold recalculates on cart change `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a store offers free shipping above a threshold (e.g., orders over $100), the shipping cost must recalculate every time the cart changes (add/remove items, change quantity, apply/remove coupon). The threshold applies to the cart subtotal after discounts but before tax. A progress indicator ("$15 away from free shipping") is recommended.
- **Verify:** Cart = $90 → standard shipping = $10. Add item ($20) → cart = $110 → shipping = $0 (free). Apply coupon reducing total to $95 → free shipping removed, shipping = $10 again.
- **Violation signal:** Free shipping not recalculated after cart change; threshold applies to pre-discount total; free shipping persists after coupon reduces total below threshold.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (cart + checkout shipping), qa-backend-expert (shipping calculation API)

### BL-SHIP-004: Shipping method selection persists through checkout edits `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Once a customer selects a shipping method, that selection must persist through address edits, payment entry, and back-navigation within checkout — unless the address change invalidates the method (BL-SHIP-001). The selected method's rate is locked at selection time — no silent rate changes during checkout.
- **Verify:** Select "Express $15" → go to payment step → go back to shipping → "Express $15" still selected. Edit address (same zone) → method and rate persist. Edit address (different zone) → method deselected with notification.
- **Violation signal:** Shipping selection lost on back-navigation; rate changes silently during checkout; method persists after address change to incompatible zone.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout navigation), qa-testing-expert (multi-step checkout)

## Domain 10a: BOPIS-Specific Rules (BL-BOPIS)

These invariants are extracted from BOPIS suite assertions (suites 036–038). They complement the general Shipping & BOPIS rules in Domain 10 with BOPIS-specific behavioral contracts.

### BL-BOPIS-001: Cart-level Pickup toggle assigns a single pickup shipment to all items `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The storefront exposes a cart-level Pickup/Shipping toggle (not per-line). When the customer selects Pickup, all items are assigned to a single pickup shipment. The cart xAPI must return exactly one shipment with `shipmentMethodCode = "BuyOnlinePickupInStore"`, `shipmentMethodOption = "Pickup"`, and **`pickupLocation.id` populated** (output field `pickupLocation { id }`; the write side is `InputShipmentType.pickupLocationId`). `fulfillmentCenterId` may legitimately be **null** on a pickup shipment and MUST NOT be treated as a violation. The shipment's `deliveryAddress` is **populated** with the pickup location's physical address — that is expected, not a violation. Switching back to Shipping must clear the pickup location and revert to a standard delivery shipment. (Live-verified 2026-07-15; corroborated by suite `050k` PCK-GQL-094.)
- **Verify:** Select cart-level Pickup → choose a store → inspect cart xAPI `shipments[]` → exactly one shipment with `pickupLocation { id }` set (`fulfillmentCenterId` may be null; `deliveryAddress` carries the pickup location's address) → checkout shows pickup store, no shipping-address entry form → switch to Shipping → `pickupLocation` cleared, delivery-address form appears.
- **Violation signal:** Cart xAPI returns zero shipments or more than one shipment for a pure-BOPIS cart; `pickupLocation.id` is null after Pickup is confirmed; switching to Delivery does not clear the pickup location. (Note: a null `fulfillmentCenterId` or a populated `deliveryAddress` on a pickup shipment is EXPECTED, not a violation.)
- **Note:** Per-line mixed fulfillment (some items pickup, some delivery in the same cart) is not supported in v2.48.0. This invariant will be updated when mixed-mode ships.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (cart Pickup toggle, checkout), qa-backend-expert (cart xAPI `shipments[]`)

### BL-BOPIS-002: BOPIS pickup always has $0 shipping cost `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Items selected for in-store pickup must have $0.00 shipping cost regardless of cart subtotal, applied promotions, or the presence of other delivery items in the same cart. The $0 pickup cost must not be inflated by any shipping fee calculation. The order confirmation and Admin order detail must also show $0 for the pickup shipment.
- **Verify:** Add BOPIS item → checkout → shipping section shows $0.00 → add a delivery item → delivery shipment shows a shipping rate, pickup section still shows $0 → place order → Admin order detail shows pickup shipment with $0 shipping.
- **Violation signal:** Pickup item shows a non-zero shipping cost; free shipping promotion applied to pickup item (redundant but incorrect base); Admin order shows shipping fee on pickup shipment.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout totals), qa-backend-expert (order shipment API)

### BL-BOPIS-003: FFC availability label matches actual stock level `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The availability label shown for each fulfillment center in the BOPIS store-selector modal must accurately reflect the product's stock at that FFC. The backend `ProductPickupLocation.AvailabilityType` is one of **three** values: `Today` (in stock at the location's own FFC, default note "Today"), `Transfer` (available via the location's configured transfer FFCs) or `GlobalTransfer` (covered by store-wide global transfer); both transfer tiers default to the note "Via transfer". The displayed strings are theme-localizable settings (`TodayAvailabilityNote` / `TransferAvailabilityNote` / `GlobalTransferAvailabilityNote`), **not fixed literals**. A location where the product is wholly unavailable (no own stock, no transfer, global transfer off) is **EXCLUDED from the result entirely** (the service returns `null`) rather than shown with a "Not Available" label. Labels must update after stock changes within the 120s consistency window (BL-CROSS-009).
- **Verify:** FFC-A has qty=5 → location shows the "Today" note. Set FFC-A qty=0 → wait 120s → the location **disappears** from the selector (or, if global transfer is enabled, downgrades to the transfer note). Set qty at a transfer FFC → location shows the "Via transfer" note.
- **Violation signal:** "Today"/in-stock note shown when the FFC qty=0; transfer note shown for direct-availability stock; label stale beyond 120s; a wholly-unavailable location rendered with a visible "Not Available" row instead of being dropped.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (BOPIS modal labels), qa-backend-expert (inventory API, FFC data)
- **Source:** vc-module-x-pickup `ProductPickupAvailability.cs` (Today / Transfer / GlobalTransfer constants) + `ProductPickupLocation.cs` (`AvailabilityType`, `AvailabilityNote`, nullable `AvailableQuantity`).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED — Today/Transfer tier core 3/3; null-exclusion + 120s clauses not re-exercised this pass; Rule unchanged)

### BL-BOPIS-004: BOPIS store-selector modal is view-only on PDP `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The "Check Availability" / "Pick Up In Store" modal on the Product Detail Page (PDP) is a read-only view. It shows which stores have the product available but does NOT add the product to cart or select a pickup location. Cart addition and pickup-store selection happen from the cart page, not the PDP modal. The modal must close cleanly without side effects.
- **Verify:** Open PDP → open BOPIS modal → verify no "Add to Cart" button inside modal → close modal → cart is empty (no items added) → no store selection persisted.
- **Violation signal:** Modal adds item to cart on open or close; modal persists a store selection without user action; modal has a functional "Add to Cart" button; closing the modal triggers a navigation.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (PDP modal), qa-backend-expert (console — no addToCart mutation fired)

### BL-BOPIS-005: Inactive or closed pickup locations excluded from selector `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The BOPIS store-selector must only show fulfillment centers that are active and configured for pickup (not delivery-only FFCs). FFCs marked inactive or disabled in Admin must never appear in the pickup selector, even if they have stock. This prevents customers from selecting a location that cannot fulfill pickup orders.
- **Verify:** Create an FFC → mark as inactive in Admin → open BOPIS modal → FFC does not appear in the list. Re-activate → appears in list. Create a delivery-only FFC → does not appear in pickup selector.
- **Violation signal:** Inactive FFC shown in pickup selector; customer can select a disabled location; delivery-only FFC appears in pickup list; FFC reappears in list without admin re-activation.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (BOPIS modal list), qa-backend-expert (FFC API, Admin FFC settings)

### BL-BOPIS-006: BOPIS checkout requires billing address, skips shipping address `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** For a pure-BOPIS checkout (all items are pickup), the checkout form must NOT display a shipping address section. The billing address is still required (for payment processing). This is a strict fulfillment-type-driven form variant — the absence of the shipping address section is correct behavior, not a bug. For mixed carts (BOPIS + delivery), the shipping address section IS displayed (for the delivery items).
- **Verify:** Pure BOPIS cart → checkout → no shipping address form visible → billing address form IS visible → order placed successfully with billing address only → Admin order shows pickup location, no shipping address.
- **Violation signal:** Shipping address form shown for pure-BOPIS checkout; billing address not required; order placed without any address; shipping address form missing for mixed-cart checkout (delivery items need it).
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (checkout form structure), qa-backend-expert (order address fields in xAPI)

### BL-BOPIS-007: BOPIS store-selector map does not collapse on no-results search `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** When the store-selector modal's search returns no results, the map panel must remain visible and must NOT collapse to zero width or a hidden state. Mechanism (vc-frontend source: `shared/checkout/components/select-address-map/select-address-map-desktop.vue`): the side-by-side layout renders whenever `(addresses.length || filterIsApplied)` is true, so a no-results **search** (filter applied, zero results) keeps both panels mounted — the list sidebar is a fixed width (Tailwind `w-60` / 240 px, `shrink-0`) and the map wrapper is `grow` with the map view inside it (`data-test-id="pickup-locations-map"`, `h-full`) filling the remaining modal width and never shrinking on a no-results query. The no-results message + Reset-search button render inside the fixed-width list panel (`data-test-id="pickup-locations-not-found"` / `"reset-search-button"`), not the map. The full map-replacing not-found placeholder appears only when there are genuinely NO locations AND no filter is applied — a different state. NOTE: the ≥40% / baseline ~50% figures are a conservative live-measured floor, not an enforced CSS token; with a fixed 240 px sidebar and a `grow` map, on desktop the map is in practice well over half the modal width.
- **Verify:** Open the BOPIS store-selector modal → measure the map panel (`data-test-id="pickup-locations-map"`) width via `browser_evaluate` + `getBoundingClientRect()` → search for a guaranteed no-match term → the no-results message (`data-test-id="pickup-locations-not-found"`) appears in the list panel → the map panel remains visible and does not shrink (≥40% of modal width as a conservative floor).
- **Violation signal:** Map panel collapses to < 40% of modal width after no-results search; map panel hidden entirely; map width measured at 0px after search; map panel width decreases on no-results but not on results.
- **Cross-reference:** VCST-4518 (map collapse regression)
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (BOPIS modal layout), ui-ux-expert (layout measurement)

### BL-BOPIS-008: Confirmed cart pickup location always returned at items[0] of cartPickupLocations `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Pickup locations referenced by any cart shipment (`cart.Shipments[].PickupLocationId`, distinct, non-null) must appear at `items[0]` of the `cartPickupLocations` xAPI response, regardless of paging (`first`), keyword search, facet, or filter. Backend resolves the missing IDs separately and prepends them to the result set, ordered by `PickupLocation.Name`. This guarantees the storefront BOPIS modal can pre-select the confirmed location on reopen even when it would otherwise be paged or filtered out.
- **Verify:** Set `cart.Shipments.PickupLocationId` to a location alphabetically/positionally beyond the first paged batch (e.g., 51+ of 102) → query `cartPickupLocations(cartId, storeId, first: 1)` → assert `items[0].id` matches the confirmed location ID. Repeat with `keyword` that matches zero other locations → still returned at `items[0]`. Storefront: confirm a far-page location → close modal → reopen → radio is checked, location at top of list with no scrolling, map centered on location.
- **Violation signal:** Confirmed pickup location absent from `cartPickupLocations` response; location returned but not at `items[0]`; modal reopen shows no checked radio; map zoomed out to default after reopen; location only appears after applying matching keyword/filter; multiple confirmed locations from same cart not all returned.
- **Cross-reference:** VCST-4707 (pre-selection pagination bug); PR [VirtoCommerce/vc-module-x-pickup#8](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-x-pickup/pull/8) — adds `IncludeLocationIds` field on `MultipleProductsPickupLocationSearchCriteria` and prepend logic in `ProductPickupLocationService.SearchPickupLocationsAsync`.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (BOPIS modal reopen pre-selection — see BOPIS-091), qa-backend-expert (`cartPickupLocations` xAPI — see GQL-094)
- **Promoted:** 2026-04-28 (from `PROPOSED-BL-BOPIS-008` in `reports/test-lifecycle/TLC-2026-04-28-2050/lifecycle-report.md`).

## Domain 11: Notifications (BL-NOTIF)

### BL-NOTIF-001: Order confirmation email sent exactly once `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When an order is successfully placed, exactly one order confirmation email is sent to the customer's email address. Duplicate emails (due to retries, webhooks, or event duplication) are a bug. If the email service is temporarily unavailable, the email must be queued for retry — not silently dropped. Failed notifications are visible in Admin → Notification activity feed.
- **Verify:** Place order → check email inbox → exactly 1 confirmation received. Check Admin → Notification feed → sent status shown. Simulate email service failure → retry mechanism sends email after service recovery → still only 1 email total.
- **Violation signal:** 0 or 2+ confirmation emails; email silently dropped on service failure; no retry mechanism; notification feed shows no record.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (notification API), qa-testing-expert (email verification)
- **Source:** vc-module-order `SendNotificationsOrderChangedEventHandler.Handle(OrderChangedEvent)` — `SendOrderNotifications`-gated, `IsNewlyAdded` → one `OrderCreateEmailNotification` via `BackgroundJob.Enqueue` → `ScheduleSendNotificationAsync`; failures surface in the Admin Notification activity feed (attempt count / status).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22; CONFIRMED 3/3, Source anchor recorded, Rule unchanged)

### BL-NOTIF-002: Email content matches order data `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Order confirmation email content must match the actual order: order number, item names, quantities, prices, subtotal, shipping cost, tax, and grand total. The email uses the same currency as the order. Personalization tokens (customer name, shipping address) must be resolved — no `{{customerName}}` or blank fields.
- **Verify:** Place order → compare email content against Admin order detail → all values match. Check for unresolved tokens or placeholder text. Verify currency symbol matches order currency.
- **Violation signal:** Email shows wrong order total; unresolved template tokens; prices in wrong currency; missing items in email; order number mismatch.
- **Agents:** qa-testing-expert (email content verification), qa-backend-expert (notification template API)

### BL-NOTIF-003: Notification failure does not block order `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** If the email/notification service fails during order placement, the order must still be created successfully. Notification sending is asynchronous — it must never block or roll back the order transaction. The customer should see the order confirmation page, and the email will be retried in the background.
- **Verify:** Simulate email service outage → place order → order created successfully → confirmation page shown → order in Admin → email queued for retry (visible in notification feed as "Pending").
- **Violation signal:** Order fails because email service is down; 500 error at checkout due to notification failure; order transaction rolled back; customer sees error but order was actually created (inconsistent state).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (order API, notification service), qa-testing-expert (fault injection)
### BL-NOTIF-004: An admin Save must be observable through the API `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A Save that reports success must have reached the server. No UI success signal — a success toast, an auto-closing blade, or a refreshed `Modified` column in the parent list — may be emitted for a change that exists only in client memory, and the signal must not depend on which entry path opened the editor. A surface that deliberately *stages* an edit for a parent blade to persist later must keep that staged state visible and recoverable (no auto-close that discards it) and must not advance a persisted-state indicator such as `Modified`.
- **Verify:** Edit a field in the editing surface → Save → re-read the entity through the platform REST API (for a notification, `GET api/notifications/{type}`) and assert both the changed value and an advanced `modifiedDate`. Assert a network request was actually issued on Save. Repeat for every entry path that can open the same editor — nested from a parent blade, and opened directly by deep link — the outcome must be identical.
- **Violation signal:** The parent list shows a `Modified` date of today while a fresh `GET` returns the old value and the original `modifiedDate`; no `PUT`/`POST` is issued when Save is pressed; the edit is lost when the parent blade is closed or discarded; the same control persists on one entry path and only stages on another.

- **Docs:** PlatformUserGuide → Notifications → Notification Templates, and Order Management → Notifications: "Click **Save** in the toolbar to save the changes… Your modifications have been applied." The documented contract is that toolbar Save persists the change.
- **Source:** vc-module-notification `Scripts/blades/notifications-edit-template.js` (editor-rework branch `feat/VCST-5557`) — `saveTemplate()` (:439-475) mutates only in-memory state and stamps `modifiedDateAsString` client-side (:450); `$scope.saveChanges()` (:537-547) calls `persistNotification()` **only** when `blade.isDeepLink`, otherwise `refreshParentBlade()` + `$scope.bladeClose()` with no request at all; `persistNotification()` (:517-535) is the sole caller of `updateNotification` → `Controllers/NotificationsController.cs` `UpdateNotification` (:90-99, `PUT api/notifications/{type}` → 204). Parent-grid dates are re-derived in `Scripts/blades/notification-details.js` (:61-64).
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-29 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-29; MISSING → new invariant. Docs + source + live all present and agreeing; live-OBSERVED violation on the nested entry path — toolbar Save issued no request, the blade auto-closed discarding the staged edit, the parent grid advanced `Modified` to today, and a fresh `GET` returned the original subject and `modifiedDate`; the deep-link path persisted correctly. Tracker: VCST-5607.)

### BL-NOTIF-005: Editing a shipped predefined template warns before it replaces the default, and stays restorable `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A template shipped out of the box (`predefined`) **is** editable; saving it converts it into an override that replaces the shipped version for that language. Before that conversion the authoring surface must display a note stating that saving replaces the predefined version, and a restore path back to the shipped default must remain available for as long as the template is both `predefined` and `edited`. Restore is destructive, so it must be confirm-gated, must issue no request until the confirmation is accepted, and cancelling it must leave the override unchanged.
- **Verify:** Open a template badged `predefined` → assert the replace-the-default note renders in the authoring surface. Save an edit → assert the template persists as an override (badged `predefined` + `edited`) and that Restore is enabled. Trigger Restore → assert a confirmation is required and that no request is issued before it is accepted; cancel it → re-read the template and assert subject and body are unchanged.
- **Violation signal:** No note is shown on a predefined template, so an admin silently overwrites a shipped default; Restore is missing or disabled while the template is `predefined` + `edited`; Restore deletes without confirmation, or issues its request before the confirmation is accepted; cancelling Restore still mutates the override.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA template blade, persisted override state), qa-testing-expert (dialog behaviour + request-timing capture)
- **Docs:** PlatformUserGuide → Notifications → Notification Templates: "The **predefined** label means that this notification template is supplied out of the box. If you make changes to it and then save it, it will be replaced with your modified version, but the system will warn you… The defaults can be restored any time by clicking **Restore** in the toolbar."
- **Source:** vc-module-notification `Scripts/blades/notifications-edit-template.tpl.html` — the `class="text __note"` paragraph gated on `isPredefined && isEdited` renders on `dev` (:7) but is HTML-commented-out on the editor-rework branch `feat/VCST-5557` (:5), while its localized strings (`…notifications-edit-template.labels.note-caption` / `note-text`) still ship in every locale. `Scripts/blades/notifications-edit-template.js` — `saveTemplate()` sets `isPredefined`/`isEdited` on an override save (:457-459); `persistNotification()` flips `isPredefined` to `false` so the override persists (:521-526); the `notifications.commands.restore` toolbar command is gated on `isPredefined && isEdited` (:701-711) and routes through a typed confirmation dialog (:477-488 → `notification-templates-list-reset-dialog.tpl.html`).
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-29 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-29; MISSING → new invariant. Docs state the warn-then-replace contract verbatim; source shows the note element and its localized strings exist but are commented out on the reworked editor branch; live confirms no note renders, while the restore half is upheld, confirm-gated, and cancel-safe. The axes agree both on the intended behaviour and on the current behaviour — the deployed artifact violates the warn half. Tracker: VCST-5557.)

### BL-NOTIF-006: A code editor must not lose user content to a single undo `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The document a code editor loads is the undo baseline, not an undoable edit. On a freshly opened editor where the user has typed nothing, undo is a no-op: it must never empty or truncate the buffer, and must not mark the surface as modified. Conversely, after an undo/redo round trip that restores content identical to the loaded document, the surface must report itself unmodified (Save disabled).
- **Verify:** Open the editing surface and, without typing, read the editor's undo depth — assert it is zero. Press the undo shortcut → assert document length and line count are unchanged and Save stays disabled. Then make a real edit → undo → redo → assert the buffer matches the originally loaded document and Save is disabled again.
- **Violation signal:** A single undo on an untouched editor empties the document (length → 0) and enables Save, so the next Save would persist an empty template; undo depth is non-zero before the user types; a redo that restores identical content leaves the surface reporting itself dirty.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA editing surfaces), qa-testing-expert (keyboard-driven undo/redo)
- **Docs:** N/A — implementation-detail: code-editor undo-stack baseline; the VirtoOZ user/developer guides do not narrate editor history mechanics (bl-audit-criteria §1a class 1).
- **Source:** vc-module-notification `Scripts/blades/notifications-edit-template.js` (branch `feat/VCST-5557`) — `jsonEditorOptions.onLoad` (:191-197) and `htmlEditorOptions.onLoad` (:269-276) set `readOnly`, inject the format button and refresh, but neither calls the editor's `clearHistory()` after the binding's initial `setValue`, so the initial load stays on the undo stack (no `clearHistory` call exists anywhere in the file). The dirty check itself is sound — `isDirty()` (:714-716) and the deep `$watch` (:728-730) compare `origEntity` to `currentEntity` by value, which is why a redo to identical content correctly re-disables Save.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-29 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-29; MISSING → new invariant. Docs axis **waived N/A** (§1a class 1 — undocumentable editor mechanics), so the bar was source + live: both present and agreeing — undo depth was 1 on a freshly loaded editor and a single undo took the document from a full template to empty while enabling Save, with the redo round trip correctly restoring it and re-disabling Save. Tracker: VCST-5604.)

### BL-NOTIF-007: A user-input error in a template must not surface as a server fault `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** An unparseable template body or unparseable sample document is client input, not a server error. A render/preview request carrying such input must be answered with a client-error status and a parse diagnostic — never a 5xx — and the diagnostic must be reported inline in the authoring surface, next to the input that caused it. An **empty** optional sample document is valid input, not a parse error. Every such message, including format/validate failure dialogs, is localized like the rest of the surface.
- **Verify:** Enter an unterminated template expression → trigger the preview/render request → assert the response status is a 4xx carrying a parse diagnostic (not a 5xx) and that the diagnostic renders inline in the preview pane. Clear the sample document entirely → assert no invalid-input indicator appears. Invoke the format action on malformed input → assert the dialog title and body resolve from the locale files, and repeat under a second UI language to confirm they change.
- **Violation signal:** The render endpoint returns `500 Internal server error` for a template the user is part-way through typing; a parse failure is reported only as a generic server error with no indication of which token failed; an empty sample document is flagged as invalid JSON; a format-failure dialog shows a hardcoded English title or message under a non-English UI.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (render endpoint status + payload), qa-testing-expert (inline diagnostic, localization sweep)
- **Docs:** PlatformUserGuide → Notifications → Notification Templates (Preview step): "In case of errors, you will see a detailed report on them." — the inline detailed-report contract is documented; the HTTP status class itself is an implementation detail the guides do not narrate (bl-audit-criteria §1a class 1).
- **Source:** vc-module-notification `Controllers/NotificationsController.cs` `RenderingTemplate` (:106-124, `POST api/notifications/{type}/templates/{language}/rendercontent`) calls `_notificationTemplateRender.RenderAsync` with no input validation and no `try`/`catch`, and the controller declares no `BadRequest`/validation-problem path at all — a parse exception raised by user-authored template text propagates out of the action and becomes a 500. Client side, `Scripts/blades/notifications-edit-template.js` `updatePreview()` (:136-164) does surface the failure inline via `blade.previewError` (rendered at `notifications-edit-template.tpl.html` :101-106), but `formatSampleJson()` (:244-251) and `formatHtml()` (:278-291) raise dialogs with hardcoded English `title: 'JSON Error'` / `'HTML Error'` / `'Cannot format: …'`; `blade.isSampleValidJson()` (:661-670) correctly treats an empty sample as valid, so an empty-document "invalid" report originates in the lint gutter enabled at (:198-201), not in the module's own validity check.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-29 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-29; MISSING → new invariant. Docs cover the inline detailed-report contract (status class N/A per §1a class 1); source + live agree — the render action has no validation or catch path, and live-OBSERVED an unterminated expression returning 500 with the inline hint present, English-only format dialogs, and an empty sample flagged invalid. A further clause — "error chrome must not occlude the surface's own controls" — is deliberately **excluded**: it lacked a platform source anchor this run and is held as a draft. Tracker: VCST-5610 / 5611 / 5612 / 5614.)

## Domain 12: Import / Export (BL-IMPEX)

### BL-IMPEX-001: CSV import is idempotent `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Re-importing the same CSV file must update existing records (matched by ID or code), not create duplicates. The import uses a unique identifier (product code, SKU, or explicit ID column) for matching. If the identifier is missing or ambiguous, the import must fail with a clear error — not silently create duplicates.
- **Verify:** Import CSV with 50 products → 50 products created. Re-import same CSV → still 50 products (updated, not 100). Modify one row → re-import → only that product updated, others unchanged.
- **Violation signal:** Re-import doubles the record count; duplicate products with same code; import succeeds without unique identifier; modified records not updated on re-import.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (import API, Admin SPA)

### BL-IMPEX-002: Export matches admin grid filters `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When exporting data from Admin (products, orders, customers), the exported file must contain exactly the records matching the current grid filter/search. Exporting without a filter exports all records. The export format (CSV columns, date format, encoding) must be consistent and documented. Export must handle large datasets without timeout — catalog CSV export always runs as a Hangfire background job (regardless of record count), returning an `ExportNotification` for progress and a blob download URL on completion.
- **Verify:** Filter products by category X (showing 30) → export → CSV contains exactly 30 rows. Clear filter → export → CSV contains all products. Check CSV encoding (UTF-8 BOM for Excel compatibility).
- **Violation signal:** Export includes records outside current filter; export count doesn't match grid count; large export times out with no error; encoding issues (garbled characters).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (export API, Admin SPA)

### BL-IMPEX-003: Large import does not timeout silently `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** CSV catalog imports always run as a Hangfire background job (regardless of row count); the import API returns immediately with an `ImportNotification` for progress reporting via push notifications. The user must see a progress indicator or notification when the job completes. If the import fails mid-way (e.g., row 500 of 1000 has invalid data), already-processed rows must be committed (partial success), and the error must be reported with the failing row number and reason.
- **Verify:** Import 2000-row CSV → job starts in background → progress visible → completion notification. Import CSV with bad row 500 → rows 1-499 imported → error report shows "Row 500: invalid price format" → rows 501+ skipped or continued (based on config).
- **Violation signal:** Large import runs synchronously (browser hangs); silent timeout with no error; no progress indication; partial failure rolls back all rows; error message doesn't identify failing row.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (import API, Hangfire dashboard)

### BL-IMPEX-004: Import validates data integrity before commit `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Import must validate data types, required fields, foreign key references (e.g., category exists, currency valid), and business rules (e.g., price > 0) before committing. Validation errors must be collected and reported as a batch — not one-at-a-time. A "dry run" or validation-only mode should be available for large imports.
- **Verify:** Import CSV with: missing required field → error "Row 3: Name is required." Invalid category reference → error "Row 7: Category 'XYZ' not found." Negative price → error "Row 12: Price must be > 0." All errors reported in one batch.
- **Violation signal:** Invalid data imported without error; errors reported one at a time (requiring multiple re-imports); foreign key violations cause 500 error instead of validation message; no dry-run option.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (import validation API)

## Domain 13: SEO & URLs (BL-SEO)

### BL-SEO-001: Slug uniqueness enforced `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Every product and category URL slug should be unique within a store and language. Virto Commerce does **NOT** auto-append a numeric suffix; instead the SEO module validates a duplicate on save ("Duplicate URL detected") and surfaces store-level conflicts ("conflicting semantic URLs" with a Resolve-conflicts flow), and the SEO resolver disambiguates any remaining conflicts at request time via its scoring/priority pipeline. Uniqueness is scoped per **store + language** (the same slug may legitimately exist in different stores/languages). Case sensitivity of resolution is DB-collation dependent (case-insensitive under default SQL Server collation).
- **Verify:** Create Product A with slug "my-product" → create Product B with the same slug in the same store+language → a "Duplicate URL detected" validation and/or a store "conflicting semantic URLs" warning appears (no "-1" suffix is auto-added). Use the store **Debug SEO Links** widget to see how a conflicting slug is scored and resolved.
- **Violation signal:** Duplicate slug silently accepted with no validation and no conflict flag; two entities in the same store+language sharing a slug with no resolver disambiguation (one silently hides the other).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (catalog API, SEO settings), qa-frontend-expert (URL navigation)

### BL-SEO-002: Deleted product returns proper HTTP status `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** When a product is deleted, its slug returns an empty `slugInfo` from xAPI and the Vue-SPA storefront renders its client-side NotFound page. Because VC Frontend is served via a catch-all route, the document HTTP status is **200 by default (a documented "soft 404")** — a real HTTP 404/410 is produced only via load-balancer/CDN rules. The missing slug is logged as a broken link where an admin can assign a 301 redirect (surfaced as `slugInfo.redirectUrl`). The page must never show the deleted product's old content, blank/broken content, or a 500.
- **Verify:** Note the product URL → delete the product in Admin (or use a never-existing slug) → navigate to the URL → xAPI `slugInfo` entityInfo is empty and the SPA shows the NotFound page (HTTP 200 soft 404 by default, or a configured 301 redirect / CDN-forced 404). Never the old product content, a blank page, or a 500.
- **Violation signal:** Deleted product's old content still served; blank/broken content; 500 error; the product page still fully resolving after deletion. **NOTE:** HTTP 200 with the SPA NotFound page is the documented default and is **NOT** a violation.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (URL navigation), qa-backend-expert (routing/SEO config)

### BL-SEO-003: Canonical URL set on all pages `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Every storefront page must expose its preferred URL to crawlers. Virto Commerce's storefront (vc-frontend, `@unhead/vue`) emits this as an Open Graph `<meta property="og:url">` set to the page's own resolved SEO URL — it does **NOT** render a `<link rel="canonical">` element (verified live 2026-07-15: zero canonical tags on PDP or category pages). A product resolves to one preferred URL (whatever format `seoLinkType` yields — see BL-SEO-004), so `og:url` points to that single URL regardless of the category path taken to reach it. (A true `rel="canonical"` link would be a stronger de-dup signal than `og:url`; its absence is a documented SEO consideration, not a per-page bug — treat canonical-link emission as a separate feature-gap decision.)
- **Verify:** Open a PDP → inspect the rendered (post-hydration) DOM head → `<meta property="og:url">` present and equal to the product's own resolved URL; **no** `<link rel="canonical">` is expected. Open the same product via a different category → `og:url` still points to that same product URL. Repeat on a category listing page.
- **Violation signal:** `og:url` missing or pointing to the wrong URL; `og:url` differs for the same product across entry points (should be its single resolved URL). NOTE: the absence of a `<link rel="canonical">` tag is the documented default and is NOT a violation.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (page source inspection), ui-ux-expert (SEO audit)

### BL-SEO-004: SEO link type controls URL format `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The store setting `seoLinkType` controls how product and category URLs are generated. When changed, all storefront URLs must update to the new format. Old-format URLs should either redirect (301) to the new format or return 404 — never serve content at both old and new URLs simultaneously (duplicate content penalty).
- **Verify:** Set `seoLinkType` to format A → note URLs. Change to format B → URLs update to new format. Navigate to old-format URL → 301 redirect to new format (or 404).
- **Violation signal:** Old and new format URLs both serve content (duplicate); URL format doesn't change after setting update; old URLs return 200 instead of 301/404; broken links after format change.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (store settings API), qa-frontend-expert (URL navigation)

## Domain 14: Profile & Member Data (BL-PROFILE)

### BL-PROFILE-001: Silent duplicate-skip on `updateMemberAddresses` and matching `checkDuplicateAddress` detection `[P1-data]`
- **Rule (write path — `updateMemberAddresses`):** When `updateMemberAddresses` is called with an address whose key fields — `firstName` + `lastName` + `city` + `line1` + `line2` + `countryCode` + `regionId` + `postalCode` + `phone` + `email` (compared case-insensitively; `addressType` and the auto-computed `name` are **NOT** part of the dedup key) — exactly match an already-saved address on the same member, the server MUST silently skip the insert. No new record is created, no error is raised in `errors[]`, and the member's total address count (`currentCustomerAddresses.totalCount`) MUST remain unchanged. This holds regardless of the size of `addresses[]` (one or many) AND regardless of `memberType` (Contact or Organization — same endpoint, same dedup semantics). The dedup check is **against the member's stored collection**, not only within the incoming batch, and must NOT depend on auto-computed fields like `name` that the client submits as null.
- **Rule (read path — `checkDuplicateAddress`):** `checkDuplicateAddress(memberId, address)` MUST return `isDuplicated: true` if and only if an existing stored address on `memberId` matches the submitted address by the same key fields listed above. Novel addresses return `isDuplicated: false`; exact matches return `true`. The detection contract MUST agree with the write-path dedup contract — whatever `updateMemberAddresses` silently skips, `checkDuplicateAddress` must flag. The query MUST require authentication (no anonymous access) and MUST enforce same-member / same-org authorization (no cross-member probing).
- **Verify (write path):** Capture totalCount = N and the full field set of an existing address. Call `updateMemberAddresses(command: { memberId, addresses: [{…same fields}] })` with exactly one byte-identical element. Re-query totalCount → must equal N. Count rows in `items[]` matching the duplicate's line1 + firstName + lastName → must equal 1 (not 2). `errors[]` must be empty. Repeat with a 2-element `addresses[]` where one element is identical-to-existing and one is novel → novel row is added, duplicate is skipped, totalCount = N+1. Repeat both scenarios for a Contact memberId AND an Organization memberId.
- **Verify (read path):** With a valid bearer token, call `checkDuplicateAddress(memberId: <own>, address: {…byte-identical fields of an existing saved address})` → `isDuplicated: true`. Call with a novel address → `isDuplicated: false`. Call anonymously (no Authorization header) → request rejected with 401 or equivalent authz error; not HTTP 200. Call with a foreign memberId (different user) → authz error, no data returned.
- **Violation signal:** `totalCount` = N+1 after single-element submission; two rows with identical key fields appear in `items[]`; the mutation raises an error instead of silently skipping. For the read path: `checkDuplicateAddress` returns `isDuplicated: false` for an address that clearly exists on the member; or returns data to an unauthenticated caller (HTTP 200 without 401); or returns data when a foreign memberId is used.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (GraphQL direct — see GQL-056, and planned GQL-060/061 for checkDuplicate detection), qa-frontend-expert (storefront UI — see B2C-SHIP-014), test-management-specialist (cross-layer coverage audit)
- **Origin:** PR [VirtoCommerce/vc-module-profile-experience-api#129](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-profile-experience-api/pull/129) — adds both `MemberAggregateRootBase.UpdateAddresses` dedup AND the `checkDuplicateAddress` query, implemented once in the shared base aggregate (no per-member-type override), so the Contact and Organization paths use identical logic and the write-path silent-skip and read-path detection share one method (`IsDuplicateAddress`). The previously-reported Organization-path write-dedup miss and `checkDuplicateAddress`-always-false defects are **no longer reproducible in current source** (both resolved via the unified base aggregate); live-reconfirmed on the Contact path.
- **Promoted:** 2026-04-23 (from `PROPOSED-BL-PROFILE-001` in `reports/test-lifecycle/TLC-2026-04-23-1700/bl-proposals.md`).
- **Source:** `vc-module-profile-experience-api` `MemberAggregateRootBase.cs` (address comparer + `IsDuplicateAddress`), `CheckDuplicateAddressQueryHandler.cs` (delegates to the same method), `OrganizationAggregate.cs` / `ContactAggregate.cs` (no override — inherit the shared logic).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (approved from bl-proposals-2026-07-22 — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22: refreshed the stale Origin footnote — the Organization-path + `checkDuplicateAddress` defects are fixed in current source, triangulated source + live Contact path; Rule/Verify unchanged).

## Domain 15: UI Display & Layout Stability (BL-UI)

These invariants hold for any rendered surface — Storybook stories, storefront pages, admin SPA blades — regardless of feature spec or Figma source. They turn "looks broken" into "measurably violates a rule." Violations are FAIL even when a JIRA ticket does not call them out, because the design system contract makes them implicit acceptance criteria. Canonical measurement helper: [`scripts/lib/measure-layout.ts`](../../../scripts/lib/measure-layout.ts). **No regression suite currently covers these invariants** — suite `048b-layout-stability.csv` (selection group `layout-stability`) was removed on 2026-07-25. Until a replacement exists they are audited on demand via [`/qa-design`](../../skills/qa-design/SKILL.md) against the scope + audit protocols in [`critical-ui-scope.md`](critical-ui-scope.md).

### BL-UI-001: Layout stability on initial render `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** After first paint, visible content MUST NOT shift as late assets resolve (images, web fonts, async data, skeleton → content swap). Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) — measured via `PerformanceObserver({ type: 'layout-shift' })` summing `entry.value` where `entry.hadRecentInput === false` — must be ≤ 0.1 on initial render. Image elements without intrinsic dimensions (`width`/`height` attrs or CSS `aspect-ratio`) are the most common offender.
- **Verify:** Install the observer before navigating (`LAYOUT_SNIPPETS.installClsObserver`). Load the component / page. Wait for `load` + idle. Read accumulated CLS (`LAYOUT_SNIPPETS.readCls`). Repeat on throttled network ("Fast 3G") — late-loading images often hide shifts on fast connections.
- **Violation signal:** CLS ≥ 0.1 (FAIL), ≥ 0.25 (P0 if on checkout / cart / PDP). Visible jump as image loads. Skeleton snaps to different height when data arrives. Font swap (FOIT/FOUT) reflows surrounding text.
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (Storybook + storefront), qa-frontend-expert (revenue-critical surfaces)
- **Suite coverage:** NONE — was `048b` LAYOUT-CLS-001..004 (home, PDP, cart, checkout)
 (suite removed 2026-07-25; audit manually via `/qa-design`)
- **Promoted:** 2026-05-14 (from `ui-ux-expert.md` UI-invariants draft).

### BL-UI-002: Spacing grid compliance `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Every computed `padding`, `margin`, and `gap` SHOULD resolve to a value from the project spacing scale: the **Tailwind default scale** (0.25 rem / 4 px base unit, **including its half-steps** `0.5`=2 px, `1.5`=6 px, `2.5`=10 px, `3.5`=14 px) **plus** the vc-frontend `extend.spacing` additions in `tailwind.config.ts` (notably `4.5`=18 px, `17`=68 px, `18`=72 px, `19`=76 px). An arbitrary value that maps to no scale step (e.g. 13 px, 27 px, 41 px) is off-grid. The spacing scale is defined in `tailwind.config.ts` and is **theme-agnostic** — only COLORS are theme-driven CSS custom properties, so this is a design-system (not a per-theme "Coffee") contract. (Correcting the earlier claim of a strict 4 px multiple / a fixed allowed set: `vc-button.vue` uses `padding[2.5]`=10 px and `padding[3.5]`=14 px, and `extend.spacing` adds 18 px.)
- **Verify:** For each container and its key children, read `getComputedStyle(el).paddingTop|Right|Bottom|Left`, `marginTop|…`, and `gap` via `spacingAuditSnippet(selector)`, then `classifySpacing()`. **Never hand-list the allowed values** — the snippet embeds `SPACING_GRID`, which is derived by `npm run tokens:sync` from Tailwind's default scale (at the version vc-frontend pins) unioned with that repo's `theme.extend.spacing`; `npm run tokens:check` fails when the design system drifts. Run at the derived `AUDIT_VIEWPORTS_PX` sweep — some breakpoints introduce token overrides.
- **Violation signal:** Computed values that map to **no** Tailwind scale step (e.g. `"13px"`, `"27px"`, `"41px"`). Note: spacing in vc-frontend is applied via Tailwind utility classes / `theme()` refs, **not** `--spacing-*` CSS variables (those do not exist in the codebase).
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (component audit), qa-frontend-expert (storefront pages)
- **Suite coverage:** NONE — was `048b` LAYOUT-SPC-001..003 (catalog product cards, cart line items, checkout form)
 (suite removed 2026-07-25; audit manually via `/qa-design`)
- **Promoted:** 2026-05-14 (from `ui-ux-expert.md` UI-invariants draft).

### BL-UI-003: No state-induced layout shift `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Hover, focus, validation-message insertion, badge/counter updates, and skeleton → content swap MUST NOT move adjacent elements. A border that appears on hover must use `outline` (which does not affect layout) OR reserve its space with a transparent border in the default state. A counter widening from 1-digit to 3-digit must not push siblings.
- **Verify:** Record `getBoundingClientRect()` of a neighbor sibling (`rectSnapshotSnippet(selector)`). Trigger the state change. Re-record. Compare with `compareRectSnapshots(before, after)` — `topDelta` and `leftDelta` must be 0.
- **Violation signal:** Neighbor moves on hover. Form below a field jumps when validation error inserts. Cart-icon badge change shifts navbar items. Skeleton dimensions ≠ resolved content → snap on load.
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (components), qa-frontend-expert (cart/checkout/forms)

- **Promoted:** 2026-05-14 (from `ui-ux-expert.md` UI-invariants draft).

### BL-UI-004: Content boundary `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Text and child elements MUST stay inside their container at every supported viewport. Long content must wrap, truncate with ellipsis, or scroll — never overflow silently and never be clipped by `overflow: hidden` without an explicit ellipsis indicator. Horizontal scrolling on the document at any tested viewport (375 / 768 / 1024 / 1280 / 1920) is a bug unless the scrolling element is itself an intentional horizontal scroller (e.g., a data table).
- **Verify:** Inject stress content (80-char product title, 12-digit SKU, German-equivalent label, 4-digit quantity). At each viewport, run `LAYOUT_SNIPPETS.overflowAudit` — checks `document.documentElement.scrollWidth > window.innerWidth` (horizontal overflow) and for each suspect element `el.scrollHeight > el.clientHeight && getComputedStyle(el).overflowY === 'hidden'` (silent clipping).
- **Violation signal:** Page scrolls horizontally at 375 px. Product title is cut off mid-character with no `…`. Card stretches to fit the longest sibling's text, breaking grid alignment. Locale labels (German `Versandadresse`) overflow into adjacent column.
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (stress states), qa-frontend-expert (i18n verification)
- **Suite coverage:** NONE — was `048b` LAYOUT-OVF-001..002 + LAYOUT-VPS-001 (mobile pages, long-title injection, 50-px viewport sweep)
 (suite removed 2026-07-25; audit manually via `/qa-design`)
- **Promoted:** 2026-05-14 (from `ui-ux-expert.md` UI-invariants draft).

### BL-UI-005: Alignment in horizontal groups `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Elements in a horizontal group share a baseline: text baselines align, vertical centers align within 1 px, buttons in the same row share `height` exactly, and an icon adjacent to text vertically centers with that text (within 1 px). Product-grid cells share height per row; table-row cells share height per row.
- **Verify:** Read `getBoundingClientRect()` for each item in the row via `alignmentAuditSnippet(selector)`. For vertical-center alignment, compute `top + height/2` per item — values must match within 1 px. For row-height parity, `height` values must match exactly. The helper returns `centerDriftPx`, `heightDriftPx`, and a boolean `misaligned`.
- **Violation signal:** Cart-quantity stepper buttons sit 2 px lower than the number field. Icon-and-label pair has icon offset upward. One product card in a row is taller than its neighbors, breaking the grid. Table row heights drift from row to row.
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (component rows), qa-frontend-expert (PDP, cart, tables)
- **Suite coverage:** NONE — was `048b` LAYOUT-ALN-001..002 (product grid row, cart-row stepper/price/remove)
 (suite removed 2026-07-25; audit manually via `/qa-design`)
- **Promoted:** 2026-05-14 (from `ui-ux-expert.md` UI-invariants draft).

### BL-UI-006: Touch target size and spacing `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** At mobile viewport (≤ 768 px), every interactive element — `<button>`, `<a>`, `<input type="checkbox|radio">`, `[role="button"]`, custom steppers, toggle switches — MUST measure at least **24 × 24 CSS px (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8, Level AA)** and SHOULD reach **44 × 44 (SC 2.5.5, Level AAA)**, with ≥ 8 px gap from any adjacent interactive element. Padding counts toward the target; hit area is `getBoundingClientRect()` of the element including padding, NOT the visible glyph alone. **Two tiers on purpose:** the vc-frontend UI kit ships button sizes 26 / 32 / 38 / 44 / 52 px by design (`vc-button.vue` `--size`), so a flat 44 px bar marks most of the design system as broken — that produced 13 of 36 failures in run REG-2026-07-24-2121. Below AA = defect (FAIL); AA-to-AAA = design-system tradeoff (WARN), cross-check against the derived `UI_KIT_BUTTON_SIZES_PX` before filing.
- **Verify:** Set viewport to 375 px. Run `LAYOUT_SNIPPETS.touchTargetAudit` → `classifyTouchTargets()`, which tags each undersized element with `belowAA` and returns FAIL / WARN / PASS accordingly; for pairwise spacing, checks closest-edge distance ≥ 8 px. Thresholds live in `TOUCH_TARGET_AA_MIN_PX` / `TOUCH_TARGET_AAA_MIN_PX` — don't re-hardcode 44.
- **Violation signal:** 32 × 32 close button on a modal. Quantity stepper buttons 28 × 28 with 4 px between. Two checkboxes stacked with 6 px gap. A tap that should hit one element hits a neighbor instead.
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (mobile audits), qa-frontend-expert (revenue-critical mobile flows)
- **Suite coverage:** NONE — was `048b` LAYOUT-TGT-001..003 (PDP, cart, checkout @ 375 px)
 (suite removed 2026-07-25; audit manually via `/qa-design`)
- **Severity rationale:** P1 (not P2) because mobile touch-target sizing carries legal/accessibility risk that overlaps the WCAG Target Size criteria: WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) is **Level AA at 24×24 CSS px**, and SC 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced) is **Level AAA at 44×44 CSS px** (AAA in both WCAG 2.1 and 2.2). This invariant audits at the stricter 44×44 (AAA / Material & Apple HIG) bar; targets between 24 and 44 px pass WCAG 2.2 AA but still fail this invariant.
- **Promoted:** 2026-05-14 (from `ui-ux-expert.md` UI-invariants draft).
### BL-UI-007: Admin editor chrome is keyboard-operable and exposes its state `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Every interactive control an admin surface introduces must be reachable by `Tab` in DOM order, activatable from the keyboard, and must expose the correct role and selected/expanded state to assistive technology plus a non-empty accessible name. A visible focus indicator is required on focus — a control may not remove the platform outline without replacing it. Keyboard focus must never be trapped: an embedded editor that consumes `Tab` for indentation must provide an escape binding so focus can leave it (WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap, Level A). Embedded iframes carry a non-empty `title`. Text meets WCAG 2.2 AA contrast 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text); non-text affordances such as icons and focus indicators meet 3:1. **Scope:** this invariant judges the controls a surface itself adds or owns. Pre-existing platform form chrome that fails the same check is a platform-level finding — record it once against the platform, not against every module blade that renders it.
- **Verify:** From the first field of the surface, walk `Tab` through every control and assert each interactive element receives focus in DOM order and shows a visible focus indicator (`outline` or `box-shadow` resolving to something other than none while focused). For each tab- or toggle-like control assert `role`, `aria-selected`/`aria-expanded`, and an accessible name; activate each with `Enter` and `Space`. Inside any embedded code editor press `Tab` and assert focus can still leave the editor. Assert every iframe has a non-empty `title`. Sample the surface's own text and icon foreground/background pairs and compute contrast ratios against the 4.5:1 / 3:1 thresholds.
- **Violation signal:** A tab strip built from non-semantic list items with click handlers and no `role`/`tabindex`/`aria-selected` — a `Tab` walk skips it entirely and assistive technology cannot report which tab is active. A styled `<button>` resolving `outline-style: none` and `box-shadow: none` while focused. An embedded editor where `Tab` inserts indentation with no escape binding, trapping focus. An iframe whose `title` is null. A 12 px label whose foreground/background pair measures below 4.5:1.
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (a11y audit, contrast sampling), qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA blades)
- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific: a QA-authored accessibility-methodology invariant grounded in the external WCAG 2.1/2.2 success criteria rather than in Virto documentation, which states no Admin-SPA conformance target (bl-audit-criteria §1a class 2; same basis as BL-UI-006).
- **Source:** Worked example — vc-module-notification (branch `feat/VCST-5557`) `Scripts/blades/notifications-edit-template.tpl.html`: the tab strip is a `<ul>` of `<li>` elements carrying `ng-click` with no `role`, `tabindex`, or `aria-selected` (:58-77), and the preview `<iframe>` is declared with no `title` (:99). `Content/css/styles.css` styles `.nt-tab` and `.nt-fs-btn` for `:hover` and an `.__active` class but authors no `:focus`/`:focus-visible` rule (:251-320), while the module's own focus rule elsewhere sets `outline: none` (:98-101). `Scripts/blades/notifications-edit-template.js` remaps `Ctrl-Q`/`Ctrl-Alt-F`/`Ctrl-Space` in the editor's `extraKeys` but leaves `Tab` at the editor default (indent) with no escape binding (:264-268); its injected format buttons render 12 px white text on a mid-blue fill (:210-218, :302) measuring ≈2.4:1 against the required 4.5:1.
- **Severity rationale:** P1 (not P2) on the same basis as BL-UI-006 — keyboard operability and contrast carry legal/accessibility risk. A keyboard trap (WCAG 2.1.2, Level A) or a control invisible to assistive technology blocks a whole class of admin user outright rather than merely degrading appearance.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-29 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-29; MISSING → new invariant, and the first keyboard/ARIA/contrast rule in the BL-UI family — 001-006 are all layout geometry. Docs axis **waived N/A** (§1a class 2 — QA-authored a11y methodology), so the bar was source + live: both present and agreeing on non-semantic tabs, absent focus styling, an editor `Tab` trap, an untitled iframe, and sub-4.5:1 12 px text. Tracker: VCST-5605.)

## Domain 16: GraphQL xAPI Contract (BL-GQL)

Transport-layer invariants for the xAPI GraphQL endpoint at `{BACK_URL}/graphql`. These rules apply across every GraphQL operation regardless of resolver domain, and are enforced by `scripts/graphql/graphql-runner.ts` for runner-native test cases. See `graphql-schema.md` for the schema reference and `graphql-test-cases-runner.md` for the authoring contract.

### BL-GQL-001: GraphQL error contract `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Invalid, malformed, or forbidden GraphQL operations return a structured response with `errors[]` non-empty and `data: null` (or partial-null per spec). Per the xAPI GraphQL-over-HTTP contract (graphql-dotnet): **both query validation/parse failures** (unknown field, unknown root field, missing required arg, syntax error, missing `command` wrapper on mutations) **and execution/resolver errors, including auth denials, return HTTP 200** with the error inside `errors[]` — this platform does NOT return a distinct HTTP 400 for validation failures (live-verified 2026-07-22: an unknown root field → HTTP 200 with `errors[0].extensions.code=FIELDS_ON_CORRECT_TYPE`; an anonymous `orders` query → HTTP 200 with `code=Unauthorized` and `data.orders=null`). The server must NEVER (a) return HTTP 5xx for *any* client-side error (validation OR execution), (b) leak internal details in error messages — stack traces (`at System.`), SQL fragments (`SqlException`, `Microsoft.Data`, `SELECT … FROM`), connection strings, file paths, (c) crash instead of returning a structured error.
- **Verify:** Validation cases (`INVALID_FIELD`, `nonExistentTopLevelField`, missing `command` arg) → **HTTP 200** with `errors[]` populated referencing the field/arg name and the `data` entry **absent** (omitted per GraphQL spec §7.1; present-but-null only for partial-failure/execution errors); resolver/auth-level failures → HTTP 200 with `errors[]` too. In all cases the message does not match the internal-leak regex `/^((?!at System\.|SqlException|StackTrace|Microsoft\.Data|connection string|SELECT .+ FROM).)*$/i`.
- **Violation signal:** HTTP 5xx on schema-validation error; `errors[]` empty on an obviously-invalid query; stack trace or SQL fragment exposed in `errors[0].message`; thrown exception bubbles to transport layer.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (xAPI), test-runner-agent (graphql-runner.ts client-side validator enforces this contract).
- **Suite coverage:** `050g` XCC-GQL-015 (direct test); referenced by ~183 cases across all 14 GraphQL suites as the "no HTTP 500 / graceful failure" invariant.
- **Promoted:** 2026-05-15 (from `bl-proposals.md` TLC-2026-05-15-1830; 264 phantom references cleaned up across all GraphQL suites).
- **Amended:** 2026-07-22 (approved from bl-proposals-2026-07-22 — BL-AUDIT-2026-07-22: corrected the validation-error HTTP status 400 → 200, triangulated source `GraphQLHttpMiddlewareWithLogs`/`AuthorizationError:ExecutionError` + live; the prior "HTTP 400 for validation failures" clause was factually wrong on this platform).

### BL-GQL-002: GraphQL query performance thresholds `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Happy-path GraphQL operations against the xAPI complete within target wall-clock thresholds measured from request-send to response-received: simple single-resolver queries (`me`, `categories(first:1)`, flat `orders(first:10)`) **< 500 ms**; deep nested queries (`orders { items addresses inPayments shipments }`) **< 1000 ms**; introspection (`__schema { types }`) **< 1000 ms**. Thresholds are environment-specific — these are baselines for one deployment; other environments may differ.
- **Verify:** Runner-native `[PERF label=X] elapsed_ms < N` assertion against `r.elapsed_ms` captured per operation by `scripts/graphql/graphql-runner.ts`. Repeat the same deep query 5× to check for N+1: elapsed_ms should not grow proportionally.
- **Violation signal:** `elapsed_ms` exceeds threshold consistently (not just one spike); response time grows linearly with repetition (N+1 hint); timeout; 504 Gateway Timeout.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (xAPI perf), regression-orchestrator (track elapsed_ms trend across runs).
- **Suite coverage:** `050g` XCC-GQL-018 (direct test); ~75 references across 12 suites mark perf-sensitive query paths.
- **Promoted:** 2026-05-15. Note: XCC-GQL-018 PERF assertions currently fail on the environment at ~765 ms vs 500 ms target — real regression awaiting JIRA triage; NOT a flaw in this invariant.

### BL-GQL-003: GraphQL response data integrity `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Successful GraphQL operations return data conformant to the schema's declared return type: (a) non-null fields are non-null in the response (resolver did not silently drop a required projection), (b) computed/derived fields (cart totals `total`/`subTotal`/`taxTotal`/`discountTotal`; index-backed price fields `price.actual`/`price.list`) are present and arithmetically consistent, (c) mutation responses include the full mutated entity, not a partial echo, (d) after-state queries reflect the mutation's effect — no stale read.
- **Verify:** `[DATA label=X] $.path is non-null` on every required field of the projection; cross-path arithmetic checks (e.g., `subTotal.amount >= 0`; `total.amount >= subTotal.amount` when no discount; `discountTotal.amount > 0` after valid coupon); after-mutation re-read shows the new state.
- **Violation signal:** `null` returned where schema declares `T!`; computed field `0` or missing after a recalc; stale cart state returned after `changeCartItemQuantity`; `data.entity.field` exists in projection but absent in response.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (xAPI integrity), test-management-specialist (full field selection per `feedback_graphql_full_field_selection`).
- **Suite coverage:** `050a` CAT-GQL-002/022, `050b1` CRB-GQL-006/017/046/047, plus ~18 references on flows where recalculation/full-shape correctness matters.
- **Promoted:** 2026-05-15.

### BL-GQL-004: GraphQL resolver auth gating `[P0-security]`
- **Rule:** GraphQL resolvers enforce authentication and authorization at the resolver level, not the transport level. (a) **Public ops** (`categories(storeId:X)`, `__schema`, `slugInfo`): accessible without a Bearer token. (b) **Soft-gated ops** (`me`): callable anonymously but returns `{ memberId: null, contact: null }` for anonymous callers — no error, no leak. (c) **Hard-gated ops** (`orders`, profile reads, cart mutations): return `errors[].extensions.code = "Unauthorized"` for anonymous callers, `data: null`. (d) **Cross-user reads**: an authenticated user cannot read another user's `orders` / `cart` — resolver returns `Forbidden` or empty result.
- **Verify:** Same op called (1) without token → expected gate response, (2) with `ORG_USER` token → real data with valid `memberId`. `errors[0].extensions.code` checked explicitly via `[DATA label=X] errors[0].extensions.code = Unauthorized` (graphql-runner supports `errors`/`extensions` path routing).
- **Violation signal:** Anonymous `orders()` returns real data; `me()` returns another user's `memberId` or `contact`; `extensions.code` missing or wrong on rejected op; HTTP 401/403 returned instead of structured GraphQL error.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (xAPI security), qa-testing-expert (cross-user negative cases).
- **Suite coverage:** `050g` XCC-GQL-016 (direct test of all four sub-rules); ~82 references mark every operation that requires `[AUTH role=ORG_USER]` prelude (all xCart/xProfile/xMarketing mutation cases).
- **Promoted:** 2026-05-15.

## Domain 17: Loyalty & Mixed Cart (BL-LOY)

> Loyalty "Mixed Cart" mode (store setting `Loyalty.Mode = "Mixed Cart"`, `Loyalty.Currency` e.g. `PTS`) lets a single cart hold regular primary-currency lines and loyalty (points-currency) lines simultaneously, with one checkout. These invariants govern that model. Introduced with VCST-5101 / Epic VCST-5099 (vc-module-x-cart PR #120, vc-module-cart PR #188, vc-frontend PR #2310). See BL-CART-004 (currency switch, amended) and BL-CART-003 (coupon + sale).

### BL-LOY-001: Mixed Cart — promotion/coupon evaluation scoped to primary-currency lines only `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** In Mixed Cart mode, promotion and coupon discount evaluation MUST use only line items whose currency matches the cart's primary currency. Loyalty-currency lines MUST NOT enter the promotion entries, the discount base (`CartTotal`), or any reward calculation. A percentage-off coupon on a mixed cart applies exclusively to the primary-currency (e.g. USD) subtotal, independent of loyalty-line quantity.
- **Verify:** Add 1 USD line + 1 PTS loyalty line; apply a 10% subtotal coupon → discount = exactly 10% × USD subtotal with zero contribution from the PTS line. Step PTS qty 1→2→3 with the USD line constant → discount does not change.
- **Violation signal:** Discount > 10% × USD subtotal, or discount equals `(USD_subtotal + PTS_qty × PTS_listPrice) × 0.10` (PTS value folded into the base at 1:1). This is the VCST-5101 Bug-1 symptom.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (cart totals), qa-backend-expert (promotion engine API)
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart PR #120 `CartMappingProfile.cs` — `CartAggregate → PromotionEvaluationContext` iterates `CartCurrencySelectedLineItems` ("Tax and Promotion are computed only on primary-currency lines"). Note: the per-line loop is filtered, but the cart-subtotal `%`-coupon evaluates against `promoEvalcontext.CartTotal = Cart.SubTotal` — the suspected leak site (BUG-mixed-cart-coupon-pts-leaks-into-usd-discount.md). Suite: `050b4` GQL-MC-006.
- **Promoted:** 2026-06-09.

### BL-LOY-002: Mixed Cart — `addItem(itemCurrencyCode)` pins the line currency; no cross-currency merge `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When `addItem` is called with a non-null `itemCurrencyCode`, the resulting `LineItem.Currency` MUST equal `itemCurrencyCode` and the cart-product key MUST be `{productId}:{itemCurrencyCode}`. Adding the same `productId` at two different currencies MUST produce two separate line items — never a merged/quantity-summed line. (This is the Mixed Cart counterpart to BL-CART-007, which merges same-SKU adds in a single currency.)
- **Verify:** `addItem(productId=X, itemCurrencyCode="PTS")` then `addItem(productId=X, itemCurrencyCode=cart.currency)` → assert two distinct line items for `X` with different `currencyCode`.
- **Violation signal:** One line item for `X` with doubled quantity; cross-currency dedup collapses the two adds.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (addItem mutation)
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart PR #120 `CartAggregate.cs` — cart-product key / find-existing-line matches on productId AND currency. Suite: `050b4` GQL-MC-001/005.
- **Promoted:** 2026-06-09.

### BL-LOY-003: Mixed Cart — `cartTotals` exposes one entry per distinct line currency `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `cart.cartTotals[]` MUST contain exactly one entry per distinct currency present among the cart's line items. The entry with `isDefaultTotalCurrency = true` MUST correspond to `cart.currency`. Each entry's `subTotal`/`discountTotal`/`taxTotal`/`total` reflect ONLY that currency's lines. A primary-currency-only cart → exactly one entry.
- **Verify:** Mixed cart (USD + PTS) → query `cartTotals { isDefaultTotalCurrency total { currency { code } } subTotal { amount } }` → assert exactly 2 entries; the default entry's currency = cart currency; each `subTotal` = that currency's lines' sum.
- **Violation signal:** Single entry on a mixed cart (grouping broken); zero or multiple `isDefaultTotalCurrency = true` entries; a block's totals include other-currency values.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (xAPI), qa-frontend-expert (split-by-currency summary)
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart PR #120 `CartType.cartTotals` + vc-module-cart PR #188 `DefaultShoppingCartTotalsCalculator` (`cartsByCurrency`). `CartTotalType` = `{ isDefaultTotalCurrency, total, subTotal, taxTotal, discountTotal }`. Suite: `050b4` GQL-MC-002, `CRX-GQL-096`.
- **Promoted:** 2026-06-09.

### BL-LOY-004: Mixed Cart — loyalty lines excluded from the promotion context even when selected for checkout `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** A loyalty-currency line with `selectedForCheckout = true` MUST NOT appear in the promotion evaluation context's entries, and its price MUST NOT contribute to the discount base. This holds for every reward type (percentage, fixed amount, free shipping, gift). Selecting a PTS line for checkout never makes it eligible for a primary-currency promotion.
- **Verify:** Select a PTS line for checkout; apply a 100% subtotal coupon → USD lines receive a 100% discount, the PTS price is unchanged, and no discount line appears on the PTS item.
- **Violation signal:** PTS item is discounted; or the USD total discount exceeds the USD subtotal because the PTS line entered the base.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert, qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart PR #120 `CartMappingProfile.cs` (currency-filtered loop) + `CartAggregate.EvaluatePromotionsAsync` gate `CartCurrencySelectedLineItems.Any()`. Complements BL-LOY-001.
- **Promoted:** 2026-06-09.

### BL-LOY-005: Mixed Cart — a loyalty-currency line shows no "earn points" indicator `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** When loyalty points are computed for a line item, if `lineItem.Currency == Loyalty.Currency` (the store's configured points currency), the returned `loyaltyPoints` MUST be zero or null. Computing points-on-points from a points-priced item is semantically invalid and MUST NOT be displayed.
- **Verify:** Mode "Mixed Cart", `Loyalty.Currency = "PTS"`; add a PTS line → query `cart.items { loyaltyPoints { amount } }` → assert the PTS line returns null or 0.
- **Violation signal:** A PTS line returns a non-zero `loyaltyPoints` value (suggests earning points on a points purchase).
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert, qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** vc-module-loyalty `LineItemTypeHook.CalculatePoints(x.ExtendedPrice, x.ProductId)` has no currency guard; `LoyaltyPointsCalculator` resolves `PointsCurrency` from the `Loyalty.Currency` setting.
- **Promoted:** 2026-06-09.

### BL-LOY-006: Mixed Cart — currency switch converts primary lines, preserves loyalty lines `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** On a cart-currency change in Mixed Cart mode, items whose currency = the PREVIOUS cart currency MUST be converted to the new cart currency; items in any other currency (e.g. PTS loyalty) MUST retain their original currency. No line item is lost or duplicated. This is the Mixed Cart refinement of BL-CART-004.
- **Verify:** Mixed cart USD + PTS, `cart.currency = USD`; `changeCartCurrency → EUR` → USD items now EUR (EUR pricing), PTS items still PTS at original prices, item count unchanged.
- **Violation signal:** PTS items disappear, are duplicated, or are switched to the new base currency on a currency change.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** vc-module-x-cart PR #120 `ChangeCartCurrencyCommandHandler.ResolveTargetCurrency` — `itemCurrencyCode.EqualsIgnoreCase(current.Cart.Currency) ? newCart.Currency : current.GetCurrencyByCode(itemCurrencyCode)`. See BL-CART-004 (amended).
- **Promoted:** 2026-06-09.

### BL-LOY-007: Mixed Cart order — points earned and redeemed exactly once, dedup per operation type `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** On a Mixed-Cart order (`LoyaltyMode = "Mixed Cart"`): (a) exactly one `Earned` log per `(CustomerOrder, orderId)` for cash-line ProductPoints; (b) exactly one `Redeemed` log per `(CustomerOrder, orderId)` for the loyalty-currency order total; (c) both may coexist on one orderId — dedup key is `(objectType, objectId, operationType)`; (d) a Hangfire retry posts neither a second time; (e) orders paid via the LoyaltyPaymentMethod gateway are excluded (handled by the gateway).
- **Verify:** Mixed order → operation log for `objectId=orderId` has exactly 2 entries (one `Earned`, one `Redeemed`). Re-trigger `ProcessOrdersAsync` for the same order → still exactly 2 (idempotent). Second mixed order, same user → its own 2 entries. LoyaltyPaymentMethod-gateway order → 0 entries from this handler.
- **Violation signal:** 0 or ≥2 `Earned`/`Redeemed` for one order; missing earn or redeem (balance not deducted); retry duplicates.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** vc-module-loyalty #10 `LoyaltyProgramHandler.EarnProductPointsAsync` / `RedeemLoyaltyProductsAsync` + `LoyaltyLogicService.LogLoyaltyProgramOperationInternalAsync` (dedup by op-type); live-verified 2026-06-22 (both posted, no dup on retry). Redeem depends on `OrderTotals` being loaded (see report PP-06). Covered by suites 075b/083b.
- **Promoted:** 2026-06-23.

### BL-LOY-008: Insufficient loyalty balance blocks order creation with a typed `LOYALTY_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` error `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a cart's loyalty-currency total exceeds the user's loyalty balance, `LoyaltyCartValidator` MUST surface a `LOYALTY_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` validation error with params `{required, available}` (`required > available`), and the order MUST NOT be created — the shortfall blocks checkout. The cart MUST remain intact and readable.
- **Verify:** Mixed cart whose PTS total exceeds balance (or balance drained to 0) → cart validation returns `LOYALTY_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` with `required`/`available` present and `required > available`; order not created; cart still readable. Storefront surfaces the localized message (i18n `loyalty_insufficient_balance`).
- **Violation signal:** Order created despite a balance shortfall; missing/empty `required`/`available`; balance allowed to go negative.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert, qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** vc-module-loyalty #10 `LoyaltyCartValidator.cs` (rule 4); vc-frontend #2335 i18n `loyalty_insufficient_balance`; verified working on the environment 2026-06-22. Full negative path needs a dedicated zero-balance user (`LOYALTY_NOBAL_USER_*` fixture open).
- **Promoted:** 2026-06-23.

### BL-LOY-009: Mixed Cart earn — only cash-currency lines earn points; loyalty-currency lines earn zero `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** In Mixed-Cart `EarnProductPointsAsync`, earned points are computed exclusively from `order.Items` whose `Currency != loyaltyCurrency`; loyalty-currency (points-priced) items contribute 0. Holds both in the order-time job and the cart `loyaltyPoints` preview. Guard: `Items.Where(x => !x.Currency.EqualsIgnoreCase(loyaltyCurrency))`. Order-layer refinement of BL-LOY-005.
- **Verify:** Mixed cart 1 USD + 1 PTS → placed order `Earned` amount = points from the USD line only. `cart.items { loyaltyPoints { amount } }` → PTS line null/0, USD line non-zero. PTS-only cart → no `Earned` log (points ≤ 0 → not written).

### BL-LOY-010: Mixed Cart — a points-only cart is rejected; at least one cash line is required `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A cart whose lines are **entirely** loyalty-currency (points-priced), with no cash-currency line, MUST surface a `LOYALTY_ONLY_POINT_PRODUCTS_NOT_ALLOWED` validation error and MUST NOT be checked out. Adding at least one cash-currency line MUST clear that specific error (the cart becomes valid if no other rule fires). Implements the VCST-5103 AC "at least one common (cash) product must be in the cart, otherwise error."
- **Verify:** Auth as a loyalty user in a Mixed-Cart store; build a cart with only a PTS line → `cart.validationErrors` contains `LOYALTY_ONLY_POINT_PRODUCTS_NOT_ALLOWED`; add a cash line and re-read → that error code is gone.
- **Violation signal:** A points-only cart validates clean / is allowed to check out; or the error fails to clear after a cash line is added.

### BL-LOY-012: The loyalty payment gateway is only valid in Payment Method mode `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** When a cart carries a payment whose gateway code is `LoyaltyPaymentMethod` and the store loyalty mode is anything other than `"Payment Method"`, the cart MUST surface a `LOYALTY_PAYMENT_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` validation error and MUST NOT be checked out.
- **Verify:** In a non-Payment-Method store (e.g. the seeded Mixed Cart mode), add a payment via the `LoyaltyPaymentMethod` gateway → `cart.validationErrors` contains `LOYALTY_PAYMENT_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`. (`addOrUpdateCartPayment` accepts the gateway code without a registered-method requirement, so no mode flip or gateway provisioning is needed to exercise this.)
- **Violation signal:** A `LoyaltyPaymentMethod` payment is accepted outside Payment Method mode; checkout proceeds.

### BL-LOY-013: Mixed Cart order — `order.orderTotals` exposes one entry per distinct line currency `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The GraphQL `order` query MUST return `orderTotals: [OrderTotalType]` with exactly one element per distinct line-item currency on the order. Each element carries `isDefaultTotalCurrency` (`true` for the store's primary currency, `false` otherwise) and per-currency `total`/`subTotal`/`taxTotal`/`discountTotal` (`MoneyType`). Exactly one element has `isDefaultTotalCurrency = true`. A single-currency order returns one element; a mixed-cart loyalty order (cash + points) returns ≥2. The order's top-level scalar `total`/`subTotal`/`taxTotal`/`discountTotal` reflect ONLY the primary-currency leg — the loyalty (points) leg is exposed exclusively in the non-default `orderTotals` element. Order-level analog of BL-LOY-003 (cart-level `cartTotals`). NOTE: the deployed field is `orderTotals`, not `totals` as the originating story (VCST-5104) worded it.
- **Verify:** Place a mixed-cart order (1 USD line + 1 PTS line); query `order(number: …) { total { amount currency { code } } orderTotals { isDefaultTotalCurrency total { amount currency { code } } subTotal { amount } } }` → assert exactly 2 `orderTotals` entries; exactly one `isDefaultTotalCurrency = true` (currency = store currency); the non-default entry's currency = the loyalty/points currency; top-level `total` equals the default entry's `total`. Single-currency order → `orderTotals` length 1, `isDefaultTotalCurrency = true`.
- **Violation signal:** A single `orderTotals` entry on a mixed-currency order (grouping broken); zero or multiple `isDefaultTotalCurrency = true` entries; the points leg leaks into the top-level scalar totals; an entry's totals mix amounts from another currency.

### BL-LOY-014: Mixed Cart order — Admin SPA Line items blade shows per-currency totals independently `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** In the Admin SPA, the order **Line items** blade for a mixed-currency order MUST display one totals summary bar per currency (e.g. a USD bar and a PTS bar), and the line items table MUST carry a per-row **Currency** column so each line's currency is unambiguous. Neither currency's totals may be omitted. The order's top-level totals accordion legitimately shows the primary-currency total only — the per-currency split is surfaced in the Line items blade.
- **Verify:** Open the Admin (`{{BACK_URL}}`, `@td(ADMIN_DEFAULT)`), Orders → open a mixed-cart order (one PTS line + one USD line) → open the **Line items** accordion → assert two totals bars (one USD, one PTS) above the table, and a **Currency** column showing PTS for the loyalty line and USD for the cash line.
- **Violation signal:** The Line items blade shows only the primary-currency totals; the points-line total is absent from the summary bars despite PTS line items in the table; the Currency column is missing.

### BL-LOY-015: A subsystem that settles many entities per event MUST expose per-entity attribution of the settlement `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** Where a single business event (an order insert) settles MULTIPLE independent entities in one pass — several loyalty missions advancing and granting from one order — each resulting ledger entry MUST be attributable, through a reachable API, to the specific entity that caused it. A points-ledger row MUST let a caller answer *"which mission granted this?"*, and a progress record MUST let a caller answer *"did this order contribute to this mission?"*. An aggregate — a balance total, a history row count, a sum — is NOT attribution: it is moved by every entity that settled in the same event, so it can neither confirm nor refute any single entity's contribution.
- **Verify:** Introspect the loyalty GraphQL surface and read a settled ledger entry: the entry (or a sibling query reachable by the same caller) MUST carry the id of the granting mission alongside the order reference. Then place one order that satisfies two or more missions and confirm each grant is separately identifiable. Not satisfied by an entry that carries only an order reference, because one order legitimately produces several entries.
- **Violation signal:** The ledger row exposes only an order reference (`type` / `orderId` / `orderNumber`) and no entity id; a single order yields multiple grant rows that cannot be told apart except by amount; a test or a customer asking "which mission paid these points?" has no query that answers it. Downstream symptom: every assertion about one entity's contribution degrades to a total, and any such assertion silently measures co-settling entities as well.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific extension: the Loyalty Missions capability ships in `vc-module-loyalty` PR #14 and has no VirtoOZ user- or developer-guide surface to state this (checked 2026-08-28, absent).
- **Source:** `VirtoCommerce/vc-module-loyalty` @ `1be73b4` — `LoyaltyMissionTransaction` carries `MissionId`, `ObjectId`, `UserId` behind `IX_LoyaltyMissionTransaction_MissionId_ObjectId_UserId` and is the record the accrual dedup reads (`LoyaltyMissionLogicService.cs:311`, `:488-497`), but no query, type or field exposes it. Live introspection of the deployed schema (2026-08-28, vcst-qa): the entire loyalty surface is `loyaltyBalance(userId, orderId)` / `loyaltyPointsHistory(...)` / `loyaltyMissionProgress(...)`; `LoyaltyOperationLogObject` exposes only `type`, `orderId`, `orderNumber`; the only `missionId` in the schema is `LoyaltyUserMission.missionId`, which is the progress record, not the grant. Measured consequence, run `REG-2026-08-28-1154`: one order granted `+250 / +200 / +100 / +0` across four missions, so the account's balance moved by 1058 while the mission under test contributed 508.
- **Measured, and worse than "no mission id" — a mission grant carries NO attribution at all.** Live read of the VIP fixture's `Earned` ledger (2026-08-28, 63 entries): **17 entries have `object === null`** — no order reference of any kind — and the four known mission rewards (`750`, `450`, `550`, `400`) are all in that group, one each, none carrying an object. Every one of the other 46 entries, which are product-earn, carries `type: CustomerOrder` plus an `orderNumber`. So the ledger distinguishes the two earn paths precisely by whether it records where the points came from: **program earnings are attributable to their order; mission grants are attributable to nothing.** The practical consequence for authoring is that even the fallback of pinning an entry to its order is unavailable for a mission grant — the maximum discrimination the API permits is the amount, plus the delta in the count of entries carrying it.
- **Status:** VIOLATED by the current implementation. Stated as an invariant the subsystem must satisfy, not as a description of what it does.
- **SHA note:** the `file:line` anchors above were read at `1be73b4`; the **deployed** artifact is `pr-14-da8a` (`da8abc6`), three commits ahead. The accrual code is byte-identical there — `OrderValueGoal` still returns `order.Total` (line 417) and `PerSkuGoal` still counts `order.Items` with no currency filter (420-431) — so VCST-5841's fix, which adds a `currencyCode` query argument and filters *which* missions are displayed, is **read-side only and does not close this gap**. Re-anchor the line numbers when citing against the deployed build.
- **Scope note:** Deliberately phrased for any settle-many-per-event subsystem, not for missions alone — the same failure shape applies to any handler that fans one event out across independent entities and writes to a shared ledger.

### BL-LOY-016: A mission goal measures MERCHANDISE value, not the order total `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** An `OrderValueGoal`'s progress MUST accrue the order's merchandise value — what the customer spent on goods — and MUST NOT include shipping, tax or any other non-merchandise component. A spend target is a promise about purchasing, so a customer whose goods total falls short of the target must not be credited as having reached it because delivery was expensive, and a merchant setting a $50 target must not be funding rewards out of $150 of freight.
- **Verify:** Place ONE order whose merchandise value falls BELOW the goal's target while its order total rises ABOVE it — a target placed strictly between the two readings is what makes the case decidable (`.claude/rules/test-data.md` §SECOND RULE). Read `loyaltyMissionProgress` for that user: `currentValue` must equal the merchandise value and the mission must remain `InProgress`.
- **Violation signal:** `currentValue` equals the order's grand total; a mission completes on an order whose goods never reached the target; the same cart completes or not depending on the shipping method chosen.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific extension: Loyalty Missions ships in `vc-module-loyalty` PR #14 with no VirtoOZ user- or developer-guide surface (checked 2026-08-28, absent).
- **Source:** `LoyaltyMissionLogicService.ApplyContribution` — `case OrderValueGoal: return order.Total;` (`:410` at `1be73b4`, `:417` on the deployed `da8abc6`). No `SubTotal` / `DiscountTotal` / `ShippingTotal` / `TaxTotal` appears anywhere in the mission path.
- **Live:** measured 2026-09-01 on `MSN_E2E_ORDERVALUE_003` — merchandise **45.00**, shipping **150.00**, tax **39.00**, order total **234.00**, goal target **49.5** (placed deliberately between the two readings). Result: `Completed`, `currentValue` **234**, 100%. Merchandise alone (45) would not have reached 49.5. Reproduced on a second mission and a second account (`ORDERVALUE_008`, same 234 figure at capture time).
- **Status:** VIOLATED. The implementation accrues `order.Total`, so shipping and tax inflate spend progress and a discount deflates it.
- **Measured tax model (refines the arithmetic, not the verdict):** tax is levied at **20% of (subtotal + shipping)** on this environment, across four orders — `$5/$150/$31/$186`, `$20/$150/$34/$204`, `$60/$150/$42/$252`, `$5/$150/$31/$186` (merchandise / shipping / tax / total). So the gap between the two readings widens with the shipping method, not just with the goods: on `CO260901-00040` it is **60 merchandise against 252 accrued**.
- **Corroboration — two accrual bases, one module, one account, visible in a single ledger.** On `MSN_E2E_ORDERVALUE_008` the mission advanced to `currentValue` **204** while the loyalty-PROGRAM path credited **20** for the same purchase — 20 being the merchandise subtotal. Both figures sit in one `loyaltyPointsHistory` read: the two `20` rows carry `{type: CustomerOrder, orderNumber: CO260901-00031 / CO260901-00023}`, and the ten mission-grant rows carry `object: null`. So the same module, on the same order, measures spend two different ways AND records provenance two different ways — which is the single sharpest demonstration of this invariant, of BL-LOY-017, and of BL-LOY-015 at once. Independently read 2026-09-01 (`post-state-independent-audit.json`).
- **Note:** the earlier framing of this finding said only "shipping + tax count"; the live measurement shows **both** components and a 5.2× gap between the two readings on one order, which is why the invariant is stated as merchandise-vs-total rather than as a list of components to exclude.
- Evidence artifact: `reports/regression/REG-2026-09-01-1750/post-state-independent-audit.json` — live state re-derived independently against seed generation `20260901153647-7b25` before those fixtures were re-seeded, carrying `missionId` / `userId` per row so the reading is re-checkable rather than merely reported.

### BL-LOY-017: Mission accrual counts cash-currency spend only — loyalty-currency lines contribute nothing `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** A mission goal MUST ignore line items priced in the loyalty currency. A points-priced line is a REDEMPTION, not a purchase: counting it lets a customer convert previously-earned points into fresh mission progress and a fresh reward, which is a self-feeding loop. This is the mission-path analogue of **BL-LOY-009**, which already states it for the loyalty-program earn path.
- **Verify:** Place one order mixing a loyalty-currency line with a cash line, where the points-priced line alone would satisfy the goal. `currentValue` (or the `PerSkuGoal` item's `currentQuantity`) must not move on account of the points line.
- **Violation signal:** a `PerSkuGoal` target quantity satisfied by a PTS-priced line; an `OrderValueGoal` advancing on an order whose cash component is below the target; a mission completing on a cart the customer paid for with points.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific extension, as BL-LOY-016.
- **Source:** `ApplyContribution` — `case PerSkuGoal:` iterates `order.Items` and does `item.CurrentQuantity += lineItem.Quantity` with **no currency predicate** (`:413-423`, increment `:420` at `1be73b4`; `:420-431` on `da8abc6`). `OrderCountGoal` has no `CurrencyCode` field at all and is never currency-checked — the gate at `:294` matches only `goal is OrderValueGoal`, and even that self-disables when `CurrencyCode` is empty (`:296-297`). The sibling `LoyaltyProgramHandler` does filter: `!x.Currency.EqualsIgnoreCase(loyaltyCurrency)` (`:197-199`).
- **Live:** measured 2026-09-01 on `MSN_E2E_PERSKU_PTS` — a PTS-priced line for the target SKU, order `CO260901-00007`. Result: `Completed`, item `currentQuantity 1 / targetQuantity 1`, 100%. The points-currency line was counted toward the quantity target.
- **Status:** VIOLATED on the mission path, while SATISFIED on the program path in the same module — the divergence between two accrual paths shipped in one PR is the root risk, not any single symptom.

### BL-LOY-018: A mission grants at most once, and an order contributes at most once `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** A mission MUST grant its reward at most once per progress period, and a given order MUST contribute to a given mission at most once — no matter how many times the accrual runs, the progress is re-read, or the order event is redelivered.
- **Verify:** Place TWO qualifying orders against a target-2 `OrderCountGoal`: `currentValue` must reach exactly 2 (not 4) and the mission must complete once. Then re-read `loyaltyPointsHistory` repeatedly: the entry set must be identical across reads, with no duplicate row ids.
- **Violation signal:** `currentValue` advancing by more than the order's own contribution; two ledger rows for one mission completion; a re-read producing a larger entry set.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific extension, as BL-LOY-016.
- **Source:** `ApplyMissionInternalAsync` short-circuits on a `Completed` status (`:270-273`), dedups on `(missionId, orderId, userId)` via `LoyaltyMissionTransaction` (`:311`, `:488-497`), and saves progress + transaction atomically under a per-(mission,user) distributed lock (`:322-324`).
- **Live:** two axes, both measured 2026-09-01. **Accrual:** `MSN_E2E_ORDERCOUNT` after two qualifying orders reads `Completed`, `currentValue` **2 / 2**, 100% — two orders, two increments, one completion. **Re-read:** on the VIP fixture, repeated `Earned` reads returned an identical 63-entry set with zero duplicate row ids.
- **Status:** **SATISFIED.** Recorded deliberately as a positive oracle: an oracle file containing only things the product gets wrong is one nobody trusts, and a satisfied invariant is what lets a case assert a guarantee rather than probe for a defect.

### BL-LOY-019: A cancelled order's mission contribution and its granted reward MUST be reversed `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When an order that contributed to a mission is cancelled, rejected or refunded, its contribution MUST be withdrawn from that mission's progress, and any reward the contribution triggered MUST be deducted from the customer's balance with a reversing ledger entry. Points are money: an accrual that survives the cancellation of the purchase that earned it is an unbounded grant, and a customer can farm it by ordering and cancelling.
- **Verify:** Place an order that completes a mission, confirm the grant landed, then cancel the order. Within the settlement window the mission's `currentValue` must fall by that order's contribution, its status must leave `Completed` if the goal is no longer met, the balance must fall by the reward, and a reversing entry must appear in `loyaltyPointsHistory`.
- **Violation signal:** balance, ledger row count and mission status all unchanged after a cancellation; no reversing or negative entry at any point; a mission still `Completed` at a `currentValue` equal to the cancelled order's own total.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific extension: Loyalty Missions has no VirtoOZ surface (checked 2026-08-28, absent).
- **Source:** no reversal path exists at any layer. Both loyalty handlers filter `EntryState.Added` only (`LoyaltyMissionHandler.cs:22`, `LoyaltyProgramHandler.cs:44`), so no `Modified`/`Deleted` order event is observed; `ModuleConstants` declares exactly `Earned` and `Redeemed`, so no reversing operation type can even be constructed; and `ApplyMissionInternalAsync` is insert-only with no negative-contribution branch. The **decrement primitive already exists** — `LoyaltyLogicService` computes `Balance = Earned ? balance + amount : balance − amount`, and only `Redeemed` uses it today. The missing pieces are a constant, a caller and a trigger, not a mechanism.
- **Live:** measured 2026-09-01 on seed generation `20260901184812-7332` and re-derived independently. Order `CO260901-00040` (id `e57920ab-…`, total **252.00**) was cancelled — `PUT 204`, and the order reads `status: Cancelled` on re-check. Before, after and a later independent read all show **balance 6817**, an unchanged ledger row set with no reversing or negative entry, and missions still `Completed` at `currentValue` **252** — the cancelled order's own total. Nothing moved at any layer.
- **Status:** VIOLATED — the mechanism is entirely absent, not merely incorrect.
- **Scope of the capture, stated rather than implied:** the account is shared across several of the run's cases, so its completed missions were settled by more than one order. What the measurement supports is the general invariant — **a cancellation reverses nothing, anywhere in the chain** — not a per-mission attribution claim. Per-mission attribution is not obtainable through any reachable API in the first place (**BL-LOY-015**), which is exactly why the unchanged balance and unchanged ledger set are the strongest available discriminators, and why their not moving is the finding.
- **A second-order observation worth keeping:** the cancelled order reads `status: Cancelled` while its own `isCancelled` flag remains `false`. Per **BL-ORD-009** `Order.Status` is an admin-editable dictionary rather than a fixed enum and `isCancelled` is a passive flag — so even a consumer that wanted to react to cancellation has no reliable signal to bind to. Phrase any status-gating requirement against the **dictionary value**, never against the flag or against a "Pending approval" state, which **BL-B2B-004** records does not exist on this platform.

## Domain 18: Payment Processors (BL-PAY)

### BL-PAY-001: Client-side card validation gates order submission `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** A storefront bank-card payment form validates card fields client-side — card number (Luhn), all required fields present, expiry month 01–12 with a fully-entered 2-digit year that is not in the past, CVV 3–4 numeric digits — and keeps the "Place order" / pay action disabled until every field is valid. No payment-authorization request is sent and no order is created while any field is invalid or incomplete.
- **Verify:** Enter a Luhn-invalid number, empty/partial fields, an expired or out-of-range expiry, or a short/non-numeric CVV → "Place order" stays disabled; no POST to the processor (e.g. `api2.authorize.net`) and no `createOrderFromCart`; an inline field-level error is shown; errors clear and the button enables only on fully valid data.

Raw PAN never appears in storefront network payloads (SDK tokenization).
- **Verify:** Complete a valid card payment → confirmation page with order number; cart badge empty; order in `/account/orders` and admin shows the processor method + a transaction id; no raw card number in any request body; `createOrderFromCart` `errors[]` empty.

### BL-PAY-004: AllowCartPayment renders the card form inline on /cart in single-step checkout only; multistep checkout redirects to the payment page `[P0-revenue]`
- **Rule:** When a payment method has `allowCartPayment=true`, its card form renders inline on `/cart` (no redirect to `/checkout/payment`) **in single-step checkout only**, and initialization uses the cart-context mutation `initializeCartPayment` (not `initializePayment`). The shared cart payment processor is registered only after a successful init and only while the component is mounted, and `finalizePayment` runs it only when the selected method's `allowCartPayment === true`. Switching to a non-cart-payment method must not charge the card. **In multistep checkout (`checkout_multistep_enabled=true`) the inline-on-`/cart` form does NOT apply: selecting an `allowCartPayment` method must route the flow to the dedicated payment page (`/checkout/payment`) for card entry, and "Place order" on Review must stay reachable — it must never be blocked by a cart-inline processor state that does not exist on the multistep path.** The GA4 `purchase` event fires exactly once (from `useCheckout`, not the payment component).
- **Verify:** *Single-step:* select an `allowCartPayment` method on `/cart` → inline form, URL stays `/cart`, network shows `initializeCartPayment`; switch to a manual method then place order → no charge to the card. *Multistep:* selecting an `allowCartPayment` method routes to `/checkout/payment` (NO inline form on `/cart`), card entered there, Review → Place order succeeds → paid order, not "Payment Required". Exactly one GA4 `purchase` in both modes.
- **Violation signal:** *Single-step:* redirect to `/checkout/payment` for an `allowCartPayment` method; card charged after switching methods (stale processor). *Multistep:* the inline card form still renders on `/cart` and "Place order" on Review is blocked/disabled with no redirect to `/checkout/payment` (the cart-inline path leaked into multistep). Either mode: double or zero GA4 `purchase`; `initializePayment` called instead of `initializeCartPayment`.

## Domain 19: White Labeling (BL-WL)

Per-org / per-store branding resolved after sign-in by the White Labeling module's xAPI query
(`GetWhiteLabelingSettingsQueryHandler`). These supersede the WL-specific detail formerly carried by
`BL-B2B-006` (see the cross-reference there). Grounded in `vc-module-white-labeling` source + live
the environment verification (TLC-2026-07-02-2043).

### BL-WL-001: Branding is org-context & post-auth; no enabled config → platform defaults `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** White Labeling branding resolves from the signed-in user's organization context after authentication. `whiteLabelingSettings(organizationId, storeId)` returns `null` when neither an enabled org setting nor an enabled store setting exists; the storefront then shows platform/theme defaults — no crash, no partial branding.
- **Verify:** Query for an org+store with no enabled WL setting → null; storefront renders default logo/theme.
- **Violation signal:** Error, blank header, or stale branding when no WL config exists.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert, qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** PlatformUserGuide White Labeling overview; `GetWhiteLabelingSettingsQueryHandler.Handle` → `return null` when `OrganizationSetting == null && StoreSetting == null`.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-02 (TLC-2026-07-02-2043).

### BL-WL-002: Org & store settings merge per-field, org-preferred (NOT whole-object override) `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Org and store WL settings are merged **field by field**. For each of `logoUrl`, `secondaryLogoUrl`, `faviconUrl`, `themePresetName`, `footerLinkListName`, `mainMenuLinkListName`, the org value is used when non-empty, otherwise the store value. An org that sets only some fields inherits the store's remaining fields — it is not a whole-object override.
- **Verify:** Org sets logo only; store sets theme + footer → merged result = org logo + store theme + store footer. (Live-verified 2026-07-02: Electronics org @ B2B-store → org's Watermelon theme replaces store Coffee while other fields merge.)
- **Violation signal:** Setting one org field blanks out store-provided fields; or org fields ignored entirely.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert, qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** `GetCombinedWhiteLabelingSetting()` — per-field ternaries `!IsNullOrEmpty(org.X) ? org.X : store.X` + `WhiteLabelingFlags` (HasLogo/HasSecondaryLogo/HasFavicon) picks. Refines the old BL-B2B-006 "override" wording.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-02 (TLC-2026-07-02-2043).

### BL-WL-003: Two enable layers — store master switch (storefront) vs per-record IsEnabled (xAPI) `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** White Labeling has **two independent enable mechanisms** at different layers:
  1. **Store master switch** — the store-level public setting `WhiteLabeling.WhiteLabelingEnabled` (Boolean, default `true`). The storefront (`useWhiteLabeling.ts`) reads it from the current store's module settings; when `false`, `fetchWhiteLabelingSettings()` returns early and **no** white labeling is fetched or applied — logo/favicon/footer/mainMenu/theme all fall back to theme (`settings_data.json`) defaults. Because it gates the whole store context, it **suppresses org branding too** (defaults shown regardless of org settings). This is the true master switch.
  2. **Per-record `WhiteLabelingSetting.IsEnabled`** — the enabled flag on each org/store WL *record*, applied only when the master switch is ON. It controls only whether that record joins the xAPI per-field merge (`GetWhiteLabelingSettingsQueryHandler`, `IsEnabled=true` filter). A disabled/absent **store record** removes only the store's contribution; an enabled **org record** still resolves. This is NOT a master switch.
- **Verify:** (1) Store setting `WhiteLabeling.WhiteLabelingEnabled=false` → org user sees theme defaults (no org logo/theme); set `true` → branding returns. (2) With the master switch ON, query an enabled org against a store that has no enabled store-WL record → org logo+theme still resolve (live-verified 2026-07-02, non-destructive).
- **Violation signal:** Master switch OFF but WL still applied; OR an enabled org's branding suppressed merely because the store *record* is disabled/absent (confusing the two layers).
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (master-switch/storefront gate), qa-backend-expert (xAPI record resolution)
- **Source:** `WhiteLabeling.WhiteLabelingEnabled` in `ModuleConstants.Settings.General` (`StoreLevelSettings`, `IsPublic`, default true) + storefront `useWhiteLabeling.ts` (`moduleEnabled` guard in `fetchWhiteLabelingSettings`/`setWhiteLabelingSettings`); record-level filter in `GetWhiteLabelingSettingsQueryHandler` (`IsEnabled=true`) with independent org/store per-field merge.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-02. **Corrected:** 2026-07-02 — added the store master-switch layer per user correction; an earlier same-day draft wrongly claimed no master switch existed (that draft had only exercised the record-level layer).

### BL-WL-004: Link lists resolve by name; missing → empty array, no error; footer legacy fallback `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** `mainMenuLinks` resolves the link list named in `MainMenuLinkListName`; `footerLinks` resolves `FooterLinkListName`. A NULL/empty/non-existent name yields an **empty array**, HTTP 200, no `errors[]`. Footer (only) additionally falls back to a `footer-{organizationName}` list when `FooterLinkListName` is empty (backward compat); main menu has no such fallback. Querying without `mainMenuLinks` in the selection set stays valid (optional field).
- **Verify:** Org with NULL MainMenuLinkListName → `mainMenuLinks: []`, no error; org with empty FooterLinkListName but a `footer-<orgname>` list present → footer resolves.
- **Violation signal:** Error/500 on missing list; main-menu resolving a `main-menu-{org}` fallback that does not exist in code.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `AddMainMenuLinksAsync()` / `AddFooterLinksAsync()` (footer `footer-{organization.Name}` branch); `ExpWhiteLabelingSetting` lists default to `[]`.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-02 (TLC-2026-07-02-2043).

### BL-WL-005: A WL setting binds to exactly one of Store XOR Organization `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Each `WhiteLabelingSetting` references exactly one of Store or Organization — never both, never neither. The Admin blade rejects both-set and neither-set, and blocks duplicate store/org bindings.
- **Verify:** Admin WL blade with both Store & Org set → "Both Store and Organization set" error; neither → "Store or Organization must be set"; a duplicate store/org → "Duplicate Store or Organization".
- **Violation signal:** A setting saved with both or neither binding; duplicate bindings persisted.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `en.WhiteLabeling.json` errors `store-and-organization-set` / `store-or-organization-must-be-set` / `duplicate-store-or-organization`.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-02 (TLC-2026-07-02-2043).

### BL-WL-006: Distinct allowed upload types — logo vs favicon `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** The **Logo** widget accepts **PNG / GIF / SVG**; the **Favicon** widget accepts **PNG / JPG / WEBP**. Other extensions are rejected with a "Filetype error" dialog. The sets are distinct — JPG/WEBP are favicon-only, GIF/SVG are logo-only.
- **Verify:** Upload `.gif` logo → accepted; `.jpg` logo → rejected ("Only PNG, GIF or SVG files are allowed"); `.webp` favicon → accepted; `.svg` favicon → rejected ("Only PNG, JPG, or WEBP files are allowed").
- **Violation signal:** Logo widget accepts JPG/WEBP; favicon widget accepts GIF/SVG; no filetype-error dialog on a disallowed extension.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `en.WhiteLabeling.json` — logo hint/filter (PNG/GIF/SVG) + favicon hint/filter (PNG/JPG/WEBP). Suite 067 WL-003/004/005.

## Domain 20: Sales Rep (BL-SR)

Scoped storefront GraphQL surface for sales representatives (`POST /graphql/sales-rep`) — the customers a rep serves, their orders, and dashboard/customer-profile **statistics** (order purchases, carts/projects, customer counters, top-selling products) with a server-owned filter+sort rule vocabulary. Grounded in `vc-module-sales-rep` (PR #4, epic VCST-5142; tickets VCST-5309/5362/5368/5485) README + live verification on vcst-qa (module `SalesRep_3.1000.0-pr-4`, TLC-2026-07-23-1943). Every query is authenticated and **creator + membership scoped**. Also covers the storefront hub-access gate (VCST-5494) and the embedded back-office Admin app's RBAC model (VCST-5293), audited separately on 2026-07-24 (TLC-2026-07-24-1906, BL-AUDIT-2026-07-24).

### BL-SR-001: Statistics periods are inclusive UTC instants, no server truncation; omitted bounds → all-time `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `salesRepCustomerOrderStatistics` / `salesRepCustomerCartStatistics` accept any number of aliased `period(from, to)` and `comparison(current, previous)` blocks. Both bounds are **inclusive UTC instants** — the caller sends the time component and any local→UTC conversion; the server does **no** date truncation. A `period` with no bounds → all-time (`firstOrderDate` = "customer since"). A per-request loader coalesces identical ranges so a range used by both a period and a comparison is aggregated once.
- **Verify:** Same range requested as an aliased `period` and inside a `comparison` → identical aggregate, one DB pass; a bounded `period` vs a no-bound `period` on the same customer → all-time count ≥ bounded count.
- **Violation signal:** Server re-truncates the caller's bounds to date boundaries; identical ranges aggregated more than once; omitted bounds error instead of all-time.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** module README §Order statistics ("both `period` bounds are inclusive and compared as UTC instants… there is no server-side date truncation"); live probe 2026-07-23.
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-23 (TLC-2026-07-23-1943); restored 2026-07-28.

### BL-SR-002: Statistics are creator + membership scoped — no cross-rep / unserved-org leak `[P0-security]`
- **Rule:** Every sales-rep figure (orders, carts, counts, top sellers, customer list) counts **only the carts/orders the calling rep created**, within the **organizations that rep serves** (membership scope). A rep never sees another rep's data, and an organization the rep does not serve yields no data (null / zero / empty), never a leak. Anonymous callers get an authorization error.
- **Verify:** Rep A's statistics exclude rep B's orders in a shared org; `salesRepCustomer`/`salesRepCustomerOrderStatistics` for an unserved org resolves null/empty (mirrors 050m SR-GQL-016/023); anonymous → auth error.
- **Violation signal:** Any figure includes orders/carts the rep did not create, or data from an org the rep does not serve; anonymous access returns data.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert, qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module README ("all figures count only the orders the calling rep created, within the organizations they serve (data-isolation)"); live probe 2026-07-23.

### BL-SR-003: Comparison returns the delta; `*ChangePercent` is NULL when the previous baseline is 0 `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `comparison(current, previous)` always returns the absolute change (`totalChange`, `countChange`, `averageChange` as Money/scalar) plus a `*ChangePercent`. When the **previous** period baseline is 0, the percent is **null** (no divide-by-zero, no Infinity) while the absolute change is still the full current value.
- **Verify:** Customer with orders only in the current period, none in the previous → `totalChange.amount` = current total, `totalChangePercent` = null, `countChangePercent` = null. (Live-confirmed 2026-07-23: `totalChange.amount=816`, `totalChangePercent=null`.)
- **Violation signal:** Percent renders as `Infinity`/`NaN`/`0` or errors when previous = 0; absolute change dropped when percent is null.

### BL-SR-004: Money resolves to one currency (`currencyCode` → store default → platform primary) and echoes it `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** All monetary statistics are converted to a single currency chosen by `currencyCode`, falling back to the store default then the platform primary; the resolved `currencyCode` is echoed back and `formattedAmount` is localized by `cultureName`. Mixed-currency underlying orders are aggregated into that one currency.
- **Verify:** Pass `currencyCode:"EUR"` → response `currencyCode:"EUR"`, `formattedAmount` uses the € symbol; omit → store default. (Live-confirmed 2026-07-23: EUR echoed, `€816.00`.) Assert the echoed code + symbol, **not** a specific converted amount (FX rate is env-dependent — vcst-qa EUR ≈ 1.0).
- **Violation signal:** `currencyCode` not echoed; `formattedAmount` unlocalized; per-currency figures returned unconverted / double-counted.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** module README (Money "converted to `currencyCode` → store default → platform primary"); live probe 2026-07-23.

### BL-SR-005: Statistics scope excludes flag-cancelled / prototype orders unconditionally `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The statistics scope (`salesRepCustomerOrderStatistics` / `salesRepCustomerCartStatistics`) excludes orders and carts flagged prototype or cancelled **at the entity level** (`IsPrototype` / `IsCancelled`) — unconditionally, and this does NOT loosen under any named filter. This differs from the order-*list* scope, which deliberately includes cancelled orders so that `Cancelled` is a real list filter (BL-SR-009). An order whose `Status` field merely reads a cancelled-like value **without** the `IsCancelled` flag (e.g. written directly by an external/ERP integration bypassing the platform cancel workflow) is NOT excluded by this scope and correctly counts toward every statistics figure, including the baseline/all-status one.
- **Verify:** A customer with a genuinely cancelled order (`IsCancelled=true`) → every statistics figure excludes it under any filter, including `filter:"Cancelled"`. A customer with a `Status`-only cancelled-looking order (`IsCancelled=false`) → the baseline/all-status figure INCLUDES it.
- **Violation signal:** Flag-cancelled/prototype orders inflate the baseline totals/counts; OR a flag-less, status-only cancelled-looking order is wrongly excluded from the baseline (scope matching on the `Status` string instead of the `IsCancelled`/`IsPrototype` flags).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Docs:** N/A — pre-GA module, no VirtoOZ coverage (§1a).
- **Source:** vc-module-sales-rep `RepOrderScopeQueryExtensions.ApplyRepScope` (default `includeCancelled=false` → filters `!IsPrototype && !IsCancelled`); `CustomerOrderStatisticsService.BuildQuery` calls it with no `includeCancelled` argument, so the exclusion is unconditional regardless of any status filter. Contrast `SalesRepOrderStatusService.BuildQuery`, which passes `includeCancelled: true` for the list scope (BL-SR-009).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; DRIFT — resolves the conflict between the prior text and the shipped statistics scope. Docs N/A per §1a; Source + Live agree. Live axis caveat: the field shape was observed this run, but the flag-vs-status distinction is corroborated from a captured payload rather than independently reproduced — the environment's fixtures cannot write a `Status`-only cancelled order.)
- **Promoted:** 2026-07-23 (TLC-2026-07-23-1943); restored 2026-07-28.

### BL-SR-006: Cart statistics are currency-scoped; item quantity is the shipped primary metric `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `salesRepCustomerCartStatistics` uses a cart-*kind* filter whose built-in default `"active-carts"` = non-empty carts that are **not** wishlists. `count` / `total` / `average` remain schema fields, but the shipped Active-carts widget surfaces **summed line-item quantity** (selected vs not-selected-for-checkout) as its primary figures, with `count` demoted to an internal denominator for `average`. Cart statistics are scoped to **exactly the requested `currencyCode`** — a customer's carts in other currencies are excluded outright, never folded or converted (unlike order-statistics Money, BL-SR-004). Gift line items are included in the item-quantity figures but excluded from the money total/count and from the storefront's own cart-page counter — a known, currently-unresolved inconsistency. Same `period`/`comparison` shape as order statistics; same creator+membership scope (BL-SR-002).
- **Verify:** Rep with active carts across served orgs → the `active-carts` period returns selected/unselected item quantities. A customer's carts in a currency other than the requested `currencyCode` contribute nothing to the figures (not converted, not merged).
- **Violation signal:** Wishlists or empty carts counted as active; carts in another currency folded into the requested-currency figures; another rep's carts included.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Docs:** N/A — pre-GA module, no VirtoOZ coverage (§1a).
- **Source:** vc-module-sales-rep `CustomerCartStatisticsService.BuildQuery` — `query.Where(x.Currency == currencyCode)` ("One cart per currency, mirrored on a switch, so folding every currency would report one cart as many"); `AddCartFiguresAsync` excludes `IsGift` from total/count while `AddItemQuantitiesAsync` does not.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; DRIFT — Active-carts widget redesign, per-currency scoping, and the gift-item inconsistency. Docs N/A per §1a; Source + Live agree.)

### BL-SR-007: Customer counts — `assignedCustomers` is a period-independent scalar; period counts never exceed it `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `salesRepCustomerCounts` exposes `assignedCustomers` (a scalar total of served orgs, period-independent) plus `period{orderingCustomers, newCustomers}` and `comparison{orderingCustomersChange, orderingCustomersChangePercent, newCustomersChange}`. `orderingCustomers` and `newCustomers` for any period are ≤ `assignedCustomers`.
- **Verify:** Rep serving 5 orgs → `assignedCustomers=5`; a month's `orderingCustomers`/`newCustomers` ≤ 5. (Live-confirmed 2026-07-23: 5 / 4 / 5.)
- **Violation signal:** A period count exceeds `assignedCustomers`; `assignedCustomers` varies with the period arg.

### BL-SR-008: Top sellers ranked by named sort over a period; `take` clamps at 10 (never errors); rows are a line-item snapshot `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `salesRepTopSellers` ranks products by `sort` (`by-units` default, `by-revenue`) over an optional `period`, returning the top `take` (default 5, **max 10**). `take` above 10 is **clamped** (never a validation error). Each row's `name`/`sku`/`imageUrl`/category come from the **order line-item snapshot** — no live catalog read; `revenue` is Money. Optional category `filter` restricts to that category's subtree. Creator+membership scoped (BL-SR-002); omit `organizationId` for the cross-customer dashboard.
- **Verify:** `take:5` → ≤5 rows; `take:15` → ≤10 rows, no error (live-confirmed 2026-07-23: clamped); `by-units` vs `by-revenue` re-rank; category filter narrows the set; row identity from snapshot even if the catalog product changed.
- **Violation signal:** `take>10` errors or returns >10; ranking reads live catalog; category filter ignored; another rep's line items ranked.

### BL-SR-009: One named filter rule per axis; omit → baseline; unknown name fails CLOSED (no data, no error) `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Lists and statistics blocks are filtered by a single **named filter rule** (not raw statuses), discovered per axis via `salesRepOrderFilterRules` / `salesRepCartFilterRules` / `salesRepCustomerFilterRules` / `salesRepTopSellerFilterRules` (`{name, localizedName}`). Omit `filter` → baseline; an **unrecognized name fails CLOSED** (returns zero data, never "return everything"), no error. Rule sets are overridable per project; a rule may be composite. `salesRepCustomerFilterRules` ships a single `All` baseline; `salesRepTopSellerFilterRules` names are category ids.
- **Verify:** `filter:"BOGUS"` on `salesRepOrders` → `totalCount:0` while baseline (no filter) > 0 (live-confirmed 2026-07-23: 0 vs 8); discovery returns localized names.
- **Violation signal:** Unknown filter returns the full/baseline set (fails open); a raw status/type accepted instead of a rule name; discovery returns raw enum keys.

### BL-SR-010: One named sort rule per axis; unknown name → default ordering; unsupported direction → ERROR; `customerSalesReps` exempt `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Lists are ordered by a single **named sort rule** discovered via `salesRepOrderSortRules` (`recent` default, `total`) / `salesRepCustomerSortRules` (`my-last-orders` default, `ytd-purchases`, `name`) / `salesRepTopSellerSortRules` (`by-units` default, `by-revenue`). A sort **never fails closed on the name** — an unknown/omitted rule name falls back to the domain default (no error). An optional `:asc`/`:desc` direction suffix reverses a rule **where meaningful** (`total:asc`, `name:desc`, `ytd-purchases:asc`); an **unsupported direction is rejected with an error** (`recent:asc`, `by-units:asc` → `extensions.code=ARGUMENT`). `customerSalesReps` accepts a plain member `sort` (e.g. `name:asc`) but is **exempt from the named rep sort-rule vocabulary** (no discovery query). The customers-list direction applies uniformly to member-column and order-derived (`my-last-orders`/`ytd-purchases`) rankings.
- **Verify:** Unknown sort name → default order, no error (live 2026-07-23: `totalCount` unchanged); `recent:asc`/`by-units:asc` → error `code=ARGUMENT`; `total:asc`/`name:desc`/`ytd-purchases:asc` → 200, reversed order; `customerSalesReps(sort:"name:asc")` → 200 (accepts plain sort).
- **Violation signal:** Unknown sort name errors or fails closed; an unsupported direction silently ignored; `customerSalesReps` rejects a plain `sort` arg, or honors a named rep sort-rule token.

### BL-SR-011: Sales-rep storefront UI requires permission + module enabled; org membership is gated per-route, not uniformly `[P0-security]`
- **Rule:** The storefront Sales Rep area is gated on `sales-rep:access` AND the store's `SalesRep.Enabled` setting — both required for any Sales Rep surface to appear: a non-rep buyer is gated/redirected and no `salesRep*` widget or query fires, and with the module disabled the "Sales Rep hub" rail section and routes are absent even for a permissioned rep. **Org membership is NOT a uniform third requirement:** the **rep-facing** hub pages (`/company/dashboard`, `/company/my-customers`, `/company/my-customers/{orgId}`) are reachable regardless of the rep's own organization membership — a rep's customers are the organizations they *serve*, independent of any org the rep belongs to (fix `VCST-5494`, vc-frontend PR #2391, clears the inherited `meta.requiresOrganization` on the three rep-facing routes). Only the **buyer-facing** `/company/sales-reps` contact page still requires org membership.
- **Verify:** Rep with `sales-rep:access` + module enabled → hub/my-customers/customer-profile render, including the empty "No customers found" state for a rep with **zero** org memberships; buyer → redirected, no `salesRep*` query issued; `SalesRep.Enabled=false` → hub/list/profile unreachable and rail section absent (mirrors 089 SR-FE-003). The buyer-facing `/company/sales-reps` page stays org-gated regardless.
- **Violation signal:** Any sales-rep widget/query for a non-rep; hub reachable while the module is disabled (client-side-only gate); OR a customer-less rep's rep-facing hub links render but **redirect to `/account/dashboard`** (visible-but-dead links — the pre-fix VCST-5494 behavior).
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module README ("Toggle the storefront Sales Rep UI per store"); live verification 2026-07-23 (hub route `/company/dashboard`); vc-frontend PR #2391 `fix(VCST-5494)` (merged dev 2026-07-23) narrows the org-membership requirement to the buyer-facing route only.

Re-verify (redirect→reachable) once PR #2391 deploys to vcst-qa; until then do not classify the redirect as a FAIL.

### BL-SR-012: Filter-aware empty states distinguish "no data" from "nothing matched the filter/search" `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** The orders, top-sellers and my-customers views render **distinct** empty states for "the rep has no data at all" vs "the current filter/search matched nothing" — the latter must offer a way back (clear filter/search), not read as "you have no customers/orders".
- **Verify:** A narrowing filter/search with zero matches → "nothing matches" state (with reset affordance), distinct from the no-data-at-all state.
- **Violation signal:** A zero-match filter shows the generic "no data" state; no way to clear the filter; a spinner/blank instead of an empty state.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** vc-frontend PR #2395 ("Filter-aware empty states… distinguish 'nothing matches this filter/search' from 'no data'").

### BL-SR-013: Rep-facing status / money / rule vocabulary localizes by `cultureName`; raw enum/key never surfaces `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Filter/sort rule labels (`localizedName`), order statuses (`statusDisplayValue`), and `formattedAmount` localize by `cultureName`. The storefront renders the localized label, never a raw enum value or an i18n key.
- **Verify:** Discovery queries return `localizedName` distinct from `name`; a rule chip / status / money value renders a human label, not `New`-style raw keys or `sales-rep.*` i18n paths.

### BL-SR-014: Embedded Sales Rep Admin app gates on customer-member + platform-security permissions, not on `sales-rep:access` `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The embedded Sales Rep Admin app (`api/sales-rep`) is gated by the **customer module's member permissions + platform security permissions**, NOT by `sales-rep:access` (which only defines a storefront rep) and NOT merely by the module being installed. The exact matrix (`[Authorize]` attributes; **multiple attributes = AND — all required**):
  - **Read** (`search`, `roles`, `dictionaries`, `GET {id}`) → **`customer:read`**.
  - **Create** → **`customer:create` AND `platform:security:create`**.
  - **Update** → **`customer:update` AND `platform:security:update`**.
  - **Delete** → **`customer:delete` AND `platform:security:delete`**.
  - **Account-only ops** (`{id}/block`, `{id}/unblock`, `{id}/password`) → **`platform:security:update` only** (NOT `customer:update`) — a distinct mutate class from entity CRUD.
  - An `isAdministrator` account bypasses all checks.
- **Verify:** a back-office Manager (`isAdministrator=false`) **without `customer:read`** gets the menu entry hidden and `POST /api/sales-rep/search` → 302 → AccessDenied; a Manager with **`customer:read` only** opens the app and lists reps (search → 200) but Add/Delete/Save are hidden and `POST`/`PUT /api/sales-rep` → **403**; block/unblock/reset-password succeed only with `platform:security:update` (independent of `customer:update`).
- **Violation signal:** a Manager lacking `customer:read` reaches the rep list; a `customer:read`-only Manager creates/edits/deletes a rep (UI action present or create/update API 2xx); or block/unblock/set-password succeeds without `platform:security:update`.

VCST-5293.

### BL-SR-015: Configurable layout is keyed by rep + surface + optional store; a never-saved key resolves null; per-user isolation `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `salesRepLayout` / `saveSalesRepLayout` address a document keyed on the calling user's id, the `scope` argument (a per-surface identifier, e.g. `"dashboard"` / `"customerProfile"`), and an optional `storeId` — three distinct `storeId` values (omitted, a nonexistent store, a real store) address three distinct documents. A (user, scope, storeId) combination that was never saved resolves `salesRepLayout` to `null`, never an error. A rep's saved layout is never visible to a different rep querying the same scope.
- **Verify:** Query `salesRepLayout` with a fresh `scope` → `null` (SR-GQL-099/103/116). Save under one `storeId`, query under a different `storeId`/omitted → `null`, not the saved doc (SR-GQL-104). Two different authenticated reps querying the same `scope` each resolve only their own document, never the other's (SR-GQL-102).
- **Violation signal:** A scope/storeId combination that was never saved returns anything but `null`; a rep's saved layout is visible to a different rep querying the same scope; `storeId` omitted and a real value resolve the same document.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `vc-module-sales-rep` `LayoutService.GetLayoutAsync`/`BuildNameParts` (keys the customer-preference lookup on `[PreferenceName, scope, storeId?]` under the resolved `userId`); `SalesRepLayoutQuery.Map` (`UserId = context.GetCurrentUserId()`).
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A — pre-GA module, undocumented).

### BL-SR-016: `saveSalesRepLayout` is a full-document replace, never a merge `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Saving a layout replaces the entire stored document for that key — every region and block the caller omits from the mutation is gone after the save, not merely left unchanged. There is no partial-update / patch semantics.
- **Verify:** Save a document containing two regions; save again with only one region → reload resolves only that region; the omitted region and its blocks are gone, not carried over from the prior save (SR-GQL-107).
- **Violation signal:** A region/block omitted from a save survives in the reloaded document (silent merge instead of replace).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `vc-module-sales-rep` `SaveLayoutCommandHandler.Handle` (builds a brand-new `Layout` from only `request.SchemaVersion`/`request.Regions` — the prior stored value is never read or merged).

### BL-SR-017: Persisted block order and `hidden` are independent, verbatim round-trip fields `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Within a `SalesRepLayoutRegion.blocks[]`, array position is the only signal of render order and `hidden` is a flag independent of position — both are stored and returned exactly as sent, with no server-side reordering, deduplication, or reinterpretation.
- **Verify:** Save a region with blocks in a specific order and one block `hidden:true`; reload → same order, same hidden flags (SR-GQL-100/108/109/115).
- **Violation signal:** Reload returns blocks in a different order than saved; a `hidden:true` block reverts to `false` (or vice versa) without a save.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `vc-module-sales-rep` `LayoutBlock`/`LayoutRegion` (plain properties, no reordering logic); `LayoutService.SaveLayoutAsync`/`GetLayoutAsync` (verbatim JSON serialize/deserialize, no transform).

### BL-SR-018: Save mutation echoes the persisted document, including a fresh UTC `modifiedDate` `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** `saveSalesRepLayout`'s response IS the just-persisted document — the same regions/blocks that were sent, plus a `modifiedDate` set to the save's UTC instant. A caller does not need to re-query `salesRepLayout` after a successful save to see the current state.
- **Verify:** Save a document; the mutation response's regions/blocks match what was sent and `modifiedDate` is a fresh UTC timestamp; an immediate follow-up `salesRepLayout` query returns an identical document (SR-GQL-106/115).
- **Violation signal:** The mutation response omits `modifiedDate` (or returns it null); the echoed document disagrees with what was sent; a follow-up query disagrees with the echo.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert, qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** `vc-module-sales-rep` `LayoutService.SaveLayoutAsync` (sets `layout.ModifiedDate = DateTime.UtcNow` before persisting); `SaveLayoutCommandHandler.Handle` (returns the same `layout` instance it just saved).

### BL-SR-019: `SalesRepLayoutSetting.value` (`AnyValue`) preserves its scalar JSON type across the round trip `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** A block setting's `value` keeps the scalar type it was sent as — string, number, or boolean — with no coercion. A date-shaped string is stored and returned as a string, never parsed into a date type.
- **Verify:** Save a setting `value` as a number, a boolean, and a date-formatted string; reload each → same JSON type as sent, same value (SR-GQL-111).
- **Violation signal:** A scalar value changes type across the round trip (e.g. a date-formatted string is returned reformatted/parsed, or a number is returned as a string).
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `vc-module-sales-rep` `LayoutService` `_serializerSettings` (`DateParseHandling.None`); `SalesRepLayoutSettingType` (`Value` typed `AnyValueGraphType`, a scalar passthrough).

### BL-SR-020: `scope` and `region.id` are free-form strings, not enums; an unrecognized value fails silently to a different (empty) document `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Neither the layout surface identifier (`scope`) nor a region id is validated against a fixed vocabulary — both are plain `String` arguments. An unrecognized value never errors; it addresses a document that has never been saved (`null` on read; a new, independent document on write).
- **Verify:** Query/save with a `scope` (or `region.id`) value no known surface/region uses → HTTP 200; read resolves `null`; write creates a new, independent document, never the "real" surface's (SR-GQL-105/114).
- **Violation signal:** An unrecognized `scope`/region id errors instead of addressing an empty document, or is silently coerced to a known value.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `vc-module-sales-rep` `InputSalesRepLayoutType`/`SalesRepLayoutQuery` (`Scope`/region id typed `StringGraphType`, no enum/validator); `LayoutService.BuildNameParts` (raw string concatenation, no allow-list check).
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A).

### BL-SR-021: Both layout operations require an authenticated caller `[P0-security]`
- **Rule:** `salesRepLayout` and `saveSalesRepLayout` both require a valid authenticated session. An anonymous caller never receives layout data or a successful save; the response is a structured authorization error, not a silently-empty success.
- **Verify:** Call both operations without an Authorization header → HTTP 200, the field's `data` is `null`, `errors[0].extensions.code` denotes an authorization failure; the same calls with a valid rep session succeed (SR-GQL-101/112).
- **Violation signal:** An anonymous caller receives usable data, or a 5xx instead of a structured `errors[]` entry.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `vc-module-sales-rep` `SalesRepLayoutQuery.Map` (`UserId = context.GetCurrentUserId()`); `LayoutService.GetLayoutAsync`/`SaveLayoutAsync` (`ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(userId)`) — consistent with the domain's established anonymous-access contract (BL-SR-002).
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A).

### BL-SR-022: Required layout-input fields are schema-enforced; a non-scalar setting `value` is rejected `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `scope`, `schemaVersion`, `block.hidden`, and `block.settings` are non-null on the input type — omitting any of them fails the mutation before it persists anything. `settings` may be an empty list but not absent. A setting `value` that is a list or object (rather than a scalar) is rejected, not silently coerced or dropped.
- **Verify:** Omit `scope`/`schemaVersion`/`hidden`/`settings` in turn → the mutation fails with a structured validation error before any persistence (SR-GQL-113); an empty `settings:[]` is accepted (SR-GQL-110); `settings[].value` sent as an array or object → rejected with a structured error (SR-GQL-117).
- **Violation signal:** A required field can be omitted and the mutation still succeeds; an array/object `value` is accepted or silently stringified.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** `vc-module-sales-rep` `InputSalesRepLayoutType` (`Scope`/`SchemaVersion` non-null); mirrored output shape in `SalesRepLayoutBlockType`/`SalesRepLayoutSettingType` (`Hidden`/`Settings` non-null; `Value` a scalar `AnyValueGraphType`).
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A).

### BL-SR-023: The customer-profile layout is scope-wide — one document per rep, not per customer `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The saved layout for the `customerProfile` surface has no per-customer dimension — `salesRepLayout`/`saveSalesRepLayout` take only `scope` and an optional `storeId`, never a customer/organization id. A rep's customer-profile arrangement is the same document regardless of which customer they are viewing.
- **Verify:** Save a `customerProfile` layout while viewing one served customer; open a different served customer's profile → the same arrangement renders, confirmed in **both directions** (a save while viewing customer A renders on customer B, and a save while viewing B renders on A); inspecting the `saveSalesRepLayout` mutation payload shows no organization/customer id field anywhere in the request (SR-CP-042; draft/edit-mode carry-over: SR-CP-043).
- **Violation signal:** A customer-profile layout differs per customer, or the schema/backend accepts a customer/organization argument for this query/mutation.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert, qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** `vc-module-sales-rep` `SalesRepLayoutQuery`/`SaveLayoutCommand` (only `Scope`/`StoreId`/`UserId` fields — no customer/organization id anywhere in the layout schema); live-confirmed bidirectionally on the storefront, with the mutation payload inspected and carrying no organization/customer id.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A). **Suite coverage note:** no dedicated 050m case yet cites this id at the API layer (it is API-observable via the absent org argument) — coverage gap for a future 050m addition; storefront coverage via SR-CP-042/043.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04 re-audit — strengthened `Verify`/`Source` with live bidirectional confirmation; no Rule change).

### BL-SR-024: Configurable-layout changes persist only on explicit Save, are scoped to the rep's account, and survive reload and re-authentication `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** No drag, hide, or reorder action is persisted on its own — each is a draft-only change until the rep explicitly saves, and one Save issues exactly one full-document replace (BL-SR-016), never more. The persisted arrangement is scoped to the rep's account rather than a device or browser session: reloading, signing out and back in, or opening an independent browser session all resolve the same saved arrangement. Cancel and Reset discard the in-progress draft without issuing any save.
- **Verify:** Perform a drag/hide/reorder without saving, then reload → the pre-change arrangement still renders; Save once → exactly one save call is issued; a reload and a fresh sign-in both then show the saved arrangement; Cancel and Reset both complete with zero save calls.
- **Violation signal:** An unsaved change survives a reload; a drag/hide/reorder issues a save call by itself; Cancel or Reset issues a save call; the arrangement differs after sign-out/sign-in.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert, qa-backend-expert
- **Source:** module composable governing the edit draft (`save()` as the sole mutation call site; reorder/hide actions touch only the draft) — consistent with BL-SR-015 (account-scoped key) and BL-SR-016 (full-document replace). Live-confirmed: save→reload returned the arrangement exactly; a second save fully replaced the first save's state with no leftovers; Cancel and Reset each issued zero network requests; the arrangement survived a full sign-out/sign-in.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04 re-audit; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A — pre-GA module, undocumented).

### BL-SR-025: The block registry owns structure and region placement; the saved document owns only order and hidden, with unknown types dropped and missing blocks appended `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Which block types exist and which region each renders in is decided by the frontend's block registry alone — never by the saved document. The document contributes only per-block order and a hidden flag. On load: a persisted block type absent from the registry is dropped silently (no error, no placeholder, no orphan entry); a registered block type absent from the document is appended after the document's own blocks; a registered block whose document region disagrees with the registry's region for that type renders in the registry's region, not the document's. Every such deviation self-heals on the next save — the round-trip payload always matches the registry's current structure.
- **Verify:** Plant a document containing an unregistered block type → received by the client but rendered nowhere, no console error, no gap in the layout; plant a document omitting a registered type → it appears, appended after the document's survivors; plant a document placing a registered block in the wrong region → it renders in its registry region, not the document's; save afterward and reload → the unknown type is gone and every block sits in its registry region.
- **Violation signal:** An unregistered type renders as a blank slot, an error, or a stray entry; a block absent from the document stays missing rather than being appended; a block renders in the document's region rather than the registry's; a save fails to correct a planted deviation.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert, qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module load-path reconciliation logic (pure function reconciling persisted blocks against the registry). Live-confirmed: two unregistered block types received by the client rendered nowhere; two registered blocks missing from a planted document were appended after the document's survivors; blocks planted in the wrong region were re-homed to their registry region (leaving that region empty); a subsequent save purged the unknown types and reset every block to its registry region, and reload showed no oscillation.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04 re-audit; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A).

### BL-SR-026: A layout key that was never saved (`null`) is not a failure — registry defaults render with editing enabled `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** `null` from the layout query (a never-saved key, BL-SR-015) is a normal, expected state, not an error condition — the surface renders the registry's default arrangement and leaves editing enabled, with no error alert.
- **Verify:** Load a layout-driven surface for a (user, scope, storeId) combination that was never saved → registry defaults render, Edit is enabled, no error/alert appears.
- **Violation signal:** A never-saved key disables Edit, shows an error/alert, or is otherwise treated the same as a genuine read failure.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module composable distinguishing a `null` result from a fetch failure. Live-confirmed: a never-saved rep's surface loaded registry defaults with Edit enabled and no alert.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04 re-audit; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A). **Split note:** the companion failure-handling behavior (a genuine read failure disables Edit; a genuine save failure keeps the draft and edit mode) remains drafted — its axes are source-only this run; see `bl-proposals`.

### BL-SR-027: The two widget columns are structurally separate drag groups — cross-column drag is impossible in either direction `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** The wide and rail widget columns are distinct drag-and-drop groups by construction; no widget can be dropped from one column into the other, regardless of runtime state.
- **Verify:** Attempt to drag a wide-column widget into the rail column, and a rail-column widget into the wide column → both attempts are no-ops; neither widget changes column.
- **Violation signal:** A widget crosses from one column to the other via drag.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module layout-surface component (per-column, distinct drag-group identifiers). Live-confirmed both directions as no-ops.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04 re-audit; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A).

### BL-SR-028: Stat cards park/restore by drag or keyboard; widgets hide via a dismiss control and restore only from a hidden-items tray `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** A stat card has no per-card dismiss control — it moves between visible and parked by dragging into/out of a parked zone, or by the equivalent keyboard gesture; a mouse-driven park drops at the drop position, a keyboard park appends to the end of the target zone. A widget hides via an explicit dismiss control and can be restored only by choosing it from a hidden-items tray — dragging a hidden widget back in is not a valid restore path. A parked/hidden item is absent from the rendered surface outside edit mode and appears in a distinct "hidden" grouping only in edit mode; the state persists across a reload.
- **Verify:** Confirm a stat card renders no dismiss control; drag a stat card into and out of the parked zone — both work, and the drop lands at the drop position, not appended; a widget's dismiss control hides it, and it can only be restored from the hidden-items tray; outside edit mode a parked/hidden item is absent from the page; in edit mode it appears under a "hidden" grouping; the parked/hidden state survives a reload.
- **Violation signal:** A stat card exposes a dismiss control; a hidden widget can be restored by dragging; a parked/hidden item remains rendered outside edit mode, or its state resets on reload.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module layout-region component (park-only toggle for stat cards) and hidden-items tray component (button-only widget restore). Live-confirmed: no dismiss control on a stat card; drag in/out of the parked zone both worked, landing at drop position (vs. keyboard append); widget dismiss→tray→restore confirmed; a parked card is absent from the page outside edit mode and appears under a "hidden" grouping in edit mode, including across a persisted hidden state.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04 re-audit; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A).

### BL-SR-029: Keyboard grab-and-move announces every transition via `aria-live`, with position for reorder and without position for park/restore; however a grab ended by a pointer interruption is a tracked violation `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Grabbing a block for keyboard reordering, moving it, and dropping it all announce via `aria-live`, including position (e.g. "position N of M") for reorder moves and edge cases; park and restore append to the end of their target zone and announce without a position — this asymmetry is intentional. Ending a grab must always restore the pre-grab state and announce the cancellation, regardless of what ends it — an explicit keyboard cancel (Escape / blur / tab-out) or any other interaction that terminates the grab.
- **Verify:** Grab a block via keyboard, move with arrow keys → announcements include position; drive a block to an edge → the edge announcement is distinct; park then restore via keyboard → announcements omit position; end a grab via Escape → the pre-grab position is restored and the cancellation announced; end a grab via any other interaction (e.g. a pointer action on another block) → the pre-grab position must still be restored and the cancellation still announced.
- **Violation signal:** A reorder or edge announcement omits position; a park/restore announcement includes one; ending a grab by any means other than Escape/blur/tab commits the moved position without restoring it or announcing the cancellation.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module keyboard-sort composable (`moved`/`edge` signal payloads carry position; `parked`/`restored` carry only an id). Live-confirmed: eight verbatim announcement strings captured across grab/move/edge/park/restore/drop; Escape correctly restored on all three regions and a neutral-area click also restored correctly. The same live pass also found a **pointer press on another draggable block while a grab is live silently ends the grab without restoring the pre-grab position and without an announcement**, committing the in-progress move by accident — a confirmed violation of this Rule, tracked as a separate defect rather than reflected as intended behavior.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04 re-audit; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A). **Note:** the Rule is stated as the full intended contract — restore-and-announce on ANY grab-ending interaction — precisely so the pointer-interrupt path stays a tracked violation rather than being silently blessed as acceptable behavior once fixed.

### BL-SR-030: A save already in flight cannot be duplicated by a rapid repeat trigger `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** Triggering Save again while a save is already in flight never results in a second full-document-replace call reaching the backend — exactly one save request is issued per user-intended save, regardless of how a repeat trigger is delivered.
- **Verify:** Rapidly trigger Save twice in immediate succession → exactly one save mutation call is observed.
- **Violation signal:** Two save mutation calls are observed for a single rapid repeat trigger.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module composable's save guard (client-side only — the backend has no concurrency guard of its own; each save is an independent full replace, per BL-SR-016). Live-confirmed: a rapid double-trigger on the Save control produced exactly one save mutation call; the specific guard mechanism (composable guard vs. a disabled control swallowing the second click) could not be isolated from the UI alone, so this Rule is stated as the observable **outcome**, not the mechanism.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04 re-audit; source + live CONFIRM of the outcome; docs N/A).

### BL-SR-031: A hidden widget's data query does not fire; a hidden stat card's page-level statistics query still fires unchanged `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** A widget that is hidden and saved is not mounted at all, so none of its own data queries fire on load. Stat cards are different: every card's data comes from one shared page-level statistics query, so hiding a card does not shrink that query's scope or omit it — it still fires with the same request shape whether or not any card is hidden.
- **Verify:** Hide a widget and save, then reload → none of that widget's own data queries appear in the reload's network trace (checked against a positive control with the widget visible); hide a stat card and save, then reload → the page-level statistics query still fires with an unchanged request shape. A tray-only restore without a reload is served from cache and does not exercise this — the check must cross a reload.
- **Violation signal:** A hidden widget's query still fires; a hidden stat card causes the page-level statistics query to change scope, drop a parameter, or stop firing.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert, qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module layout-surface component (mounts a block's component only when currently visible) and the shared page-level statistics composable feeding every stat card regardless of hidden state. Live-confirmed: hiding and saving a widget dropped exactly that widget's own operations from the reload trace against a positive control; hiding and saving a stat card left the page-level statistics query firing with an unchanged request shape.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-04 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-04 re-audit; source + live CONFIRM; docs N/A).

### BL-SR-032: The rail region mounts only while it holds at least one visible block, and unmounts structurally (not just visually) when empty `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** The narrow rail column is not rendered at all when it has no visible blocks — the main column then runs full width — and mounts as soon as at least one block becomes visible in it. This is a structural mount/unmount, not a visual collapse; the unmounted state persists across a reload.
- **Verify:** Hide every block in the rail and save, then reload → the rail element is absent from the page (not merely empty or zero-width), and the main column occupies the full width; restore one block to the rail → the rail element reappears.
- **Violation signal:** The rail region remains in the page (even empty/zero-height) when it holds no visible blocks; the main column does not expand to fill the freed width.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert
- **Source:** module layout-surface component (mount of the rail region gated on the count of currently-visible rail blocks). Live-confirmed: with the rail's only blocks hidden and saved, the rail element was absent from the page after reload and the main column ran full width; restoring one block remounted the rail.

## Domain 21: Accessibility (BL-A11Y)

These invariants hold for any rendered customer-facing surface on the accessibility-gated storefront themes (and, per BL-UI-007, the Admin SPA), and are grounded directly in the WCAG 2.1/2.2 success criteria rather than in Virto documentation, which states no conformance target (bl-audit-criteria §1a class 2 — same basis as BL-UI-006/BL-UI-007). Exercised by `045-accessibility-tests.csv` via axe-core scans, keyboard-only traversal, and accessibility-tree observation.

### BL-A11Y-001: Keyboard operability and focus management `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** On the accessibility-gated storefront themes, every interactive element MUST be reachable and operable via keyboard alone, in a logical DOM/tab order, with a visible focus indicator on the currently focused element (WCAG 2.1.1, 2.4.3, 2.4.7). A modal/dialog overlay MUST contain keyboard focus within itself while open — Tab from its last focusable element cycles to its first, Shift+Tab from the first cycles to the last — and closing it (via Escape or an explicit close control) MUST release the trap and return focus to the triggering control.
- **Verify:** From a neutral starting point, Tab through the surface and confirm every interactive element receives focus in DOM order with a visible focus ring. Open a modal, Tab to its last focusable element and confirm wrap to the first (Shift+Tab from the first wraps to the last). Close it and confirm focus returns to the trigger and Tab no longer reaches the closed modal's contents.
- **Violation signal:** An element skipped by Tab; `outline:none` with no visible replacement; Tab exits an open modal to page content behind it; focus remains trapped, or does not return to the trigger, after close.

- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific: a QA-authored accessibility-methodology invariant grounded in the external WCAG 2.1/2.2 success criteria rather than in Virto documentation, which states no storefront conformance target (bl-audit-criteria §1a class 2; same basis as BL-UI-006/BL-UI-007).
- **Source:** `client-app/ui-kit/composables/useFocusManagement.ts` — the focusable-elements selector and the Tab-cycle keydown handler that wraps focus at the first/last element when `trapFocus` is enabled; wired into `client-app/ui-kit/components/molecules/dialog/vc-dialog.vue`.
- **Severity rationale:** P1 (not P2) on the same basis as BL-UI-006/007 — a keyboard trap (WCAG 2.1.2, Level A) or an unreachable/invisible-focus control blocks a whole class of keyboard-only users outright rather than degrading appearance.

### BL-A11Y-002: Accessible naming and label association `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Every interactive control MUST expose a non-empty, contextual accessible name to assistive technology (WCAG 4.1.2), distinct from a generic element-type label. Every visible field label MUST be programmatically associated with its input via `<label for>`/`aria-labelledby`/`aria-label` (WCAG 1.3.1). Every informative image's `alt` describes its content/purpose; a purely decorative image carries `alt=""` (WCAG 1.1.1).
- **Verify:** Capture the accessibility tree for the surface and confirm every button/link/input exposes a non-generic accessible name; confirm each visible label's `for`/`id` pairing or `aria-labelledby` resolves correctly; confirm `<img alt>` is present and non-generic (or explicitly empty for decorative images). Corroborate with an axe-core scan (`button-name`, `link-name`, `label`, `image-alt`) — zero violations required.
- **Violation signal:** An icon-only control announced as bare "button"/"link"; an input with no associated label; a product image missing `alt`; `aria-labelledby` referencing a non-existent id.
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (component/Storybook audits), qa-frontend-expert (storefront revenue flows)
- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific: a QA-authored accessibility-methodology invariant grounded in the external WCAG 2.1/2.2 success criteria rather than in Virto documentation, which states no storefront conformance target (bl-audit-criteria §1a class 2; same basis as BL-UI-006/BL-UI-007).
- **Source:** `client-app/shared/cart/components/coupon-card.vue` — Apply/Remove buttons receive a dynamic, contextual `aria-label` from i18n keys via the `VcButton` `ariaLabel` prop, rather than a static generic label; `client-app/shared/wishlists/components/wishlist-card.vue` similarly attaches a contextual `aria-label` to its date block rather than relying on the bare visible date text.
- **Severity rationale:** P1 — a missing accessible name silently excludes assistive-technology users from a control with no visible symptom to a sighted tester, the same risk class as BL-UI-006/007.
- **Suite coverage:** `045-accessibility-tests.csv` A11Y-SR-001,002,003,005; A11Y-ARIA-001,002; A11Y-IMG-001; A11Y-FORM-001; A11Y-VCP-001; A11Y-CPN-002.
- **Promoted:** 2026-08-06 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-06; source + live CONFIRM, docs N/A).

### BL-A11Y-003: Color contrast and non-color status differentiation `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** On the accessibility-gated storefront themes, body/paragraph text MUST meet contrast ≥ 4.5:1 against its background, and large text (≥18px, or ≥14px bold) ≥ 3:1 (WCAG 1.4.3). UI-component boundaries and meaning-bearing graphical/icon affordances MUST meet ≥ 3:1 against their adjacent background (WCAG 1.4.11). Status/meaning (error, success, warning) MUST NOT be conveyed by color alone (WCAG 1.4.1).
- **Verify:** Run an axe-core `color-contrast` scan against the surface on an accessibility-gated theme; zero violations required. For a color-conveyed status, confirm an accompanying icon/text label independent of color, and recheck under a colorblind-vision emulation.
- **Violation signal:** A foreground/background pair below the 4.5:1/3:1 threshold; an axe `color-contrast` violation; a status relying on red/green alone with no icon or text.
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (component/Storybook contrast audits), qa-frontend-expert (storefront pages)
- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific: a QA-authored accessibility-methodology invariant grounded in the external WCAG 2.1/2.2 success criteria rather than in Virto documentation, which states no storefront conformance target (bl-audit-criteria §1a class 2; same basis as BL-UI-006/BL-UI-007).
- **Source:** `client-app/shared/wishlists/components/wishlist-card.vue` — the card's icon foreground is styled via a semantic design token rather than a raw hex value, routing contrast through the design-token system that governs compliance.
- **Severity rationale:** P1 — sub-threshold contrast makes a control or its state unreadable for low-vision users outright, the same risk class as BL-UI-006/007.
- **Suite coverage:** `045-accessibility-tests.csv` A11Y-CC-001,002,003.

### BL-A11Y-004: Programmatic status, state, and role correctness (axe-clean) `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Every ARIA role/state/property a component sets MUST be valid, complete, and reflect the control's actual state (WCAG 4.1.2). A message appearing asynchronously in response to a user action MUST be exposed to assistive technology at the moment it appears — via `role="alert"`/`aria-live`, or an explicit focus shift plus `aria-describedby` linkage to the field it concerns — not by visual styling alone (WCAG 4.1.3; WCAG 3.3.1 for field-level errors). A surface MUST be free of axe-core Critical/Serious violations.
- **Verify:** Trigger the async state (invalid submit, coupon apply, menu/tab toggle) and confirm the resulting node carries `role="alert"`/a live region or receives focus, with a field-level error additionally carrying a matching `aria-describedby`. Run a full axe-core scan; zero Critical/Serious violations required.
- **Violation signal:** An error/status message with no `role="alert"`/`aria-live` and no focus shift; `aria-expanded`/`aria-selected` not toggling with visible state; an axe Critical or Serious violation.
- **Agents:** ui-ux-expert (automated axe-core audits), qa-frontend-expert (storefront forms/cart flows)
- **Docs:** N/A — project-specific: a QA-authored accessibility-methodology invariant grounded in the external WCAG 2.1/2.2 success criteria rather than in Virto documentation, which states no storefront conformance target (bl-audit-criteria §1a class 2; same basis as BL-UI-006/BL-UI-007).
- **Source:** `client-app/shared/cart/components/coupon-card.vue` — the coupon-apply error paragraph is conditionally mounted with `role="alert"` only when an error exists, so its appearance in the DOM itself triggers the assistive-technology alert announcement.
- **Severity rationale:** P1 — a silent async failure leaves an assistive-technology user with no indication anything happened, the "stuck in a silent failure loop" risk ECL-15.1 names explicitly.
- **Suite coverage:** `045-accessibility-tests.csv` A11Y-SR-004; A11Y-ARIA-003; A11Y-AXE-001,002; A11Y-FORM-002; A11Y-CPN-001. (`A11Y-TOUCH-001` also currently cites this id, but its subject — 44×44px touch-target geometry — belongs to BL-UI-006; not counted as landed coverage here, remap pending.)

## Domain 22: Customer Reviews (BL-CR)

> Added 2026-08-24 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24). 51 test cases across suites `086`/`087`/`088` were already citing `BL-CR-*` ids that did not exist — false traceability (BLC-002). The ids were confirmed free (never used, never retired), so each entry is added at the exact cited id, which makes every existing citation true. Nine of the eighteen cited ids are landed here; the other nine are evidenced on Source but were not live-exercised this run and are staged in `reports/ba/bl-proposals-2026-08-24.md` rather than guessed at.

### BL-CR-001: New review defaults to unmoderated "New" status, never auto-approved `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A review created by an eligible purchaser via the create-review mutation is persisted with review status "New" (never "Approved") and is returned with a non-empty id and no validation errors. The review is NOT immediately visible to other storefront visitors — it becomes visible only after an admin moderation action changes its status.
- **Verify:** As an eligible buyer, submit a review for a purchased product → mutation returns a non-empty id with no validation errors → in Admin, the new review appears in the review list with Status = New → the review is absent from the public storefront review list until approved.
- **Violation signal:** A submitted review appears already Approved in Admin without any moderation action; the review is immediately visible on the storefront before approval; the create call returns a null id with no validation errors on a genuinely eligible purchase.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (GraphQL mutation, Admin list), qa-frontend-expert (storefront visibility), qa-testing-expert (end-to-end submit→moderate→publish)
- **Docs:** PlatformUserGuide "Manage Reviews > Moderate reviews" ("Approve review to publish the review and include it in the rating calculation") + "Overview > Key features" ("Moderation and validation of reviews").
- **Source:** vc-module-customer-review `CustomerReviewStatus.cs` (`New = 0` — the C# default enum value) + `CreateReviewCommandHandler.cs` (persists the mapped review without setting a status, so it lands on the default) + `ReviewValidator.cs` (purchase-eligibility gate runs before persistence).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry at a cited id. Docs + Source + Live agree.)

### BL-CR-008: Anonymous visitors cannot access the review-submission control `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The storefront never offers the "leave feedback" control (button or inline form) to an unauthenticated visitor — feedback eligibility is computed only after authentication, so it defaults to unavailable for anonymous sessions. This is reinforced server-side: a review requires a completed order tied to the requesting user's id, which an anonymous session structurally cannot have.
- **Verify:** As an anonymous visitor, open a product page that has approved reviews → the reviews are readable, but no "leave feedback" button or review form is present anywhere in the widget.
- **Violation signal:** An anonymous visitor sees a "leave feedback" button or an open review form; a review is created client-side without the user ever authenticating.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront gating)
- **Docs:** N/A — client-side gating mechanic; no guide states this in these terms (§1a).
- **Source:** vc-frontend `client-app/modules/customer-reviews/components/product-reviews.vue` — `feedbackAvailable` (ref, defaults `false`) is only assigned inside `onActivated`'s `if (isAuthenticated.value) { … }`; the "Leave feedback" button's `v-if` requires `isAuthenticated && feedbackAvailable`.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs N/A per §1a; Source + Live agree — an anonymous product-page visit rendered approved reviews with no leave-feedback control.)

### BL-CR-009: Leave-feedback eligibility is a three-part AND `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** The `canLeaveFeedback` query — and therefore the storefront's decision to show the leave-feedback control — is true only when ALL of: the target is a Product entity, the requesting user has a completed order for it, and the user has not already reviewed it. Any single failing condition suppresses the control.
- **Verify:** As a logged-in user with a completed order and no prior review for a product, open its page → the leave-feedback control is shown. As a logged-in user with no completed order for a different product, open that page → the control is hidden. After leaving a review, reload → the control is hidden for that product.
- **Violation signal:** The leave-feedback control appears for a user who never purchased the product, or reappears after the user has already reviewed it, allowing a second review attempt.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (GraphQL query), qa-frontend-expert (storefront gating)
- **Docs:** N/A — composite eligibility mechanic (§1a).
- **Source:** vc-module-customer-review `CanLeaveFeedbackQueryHandler.cs` (`IsProductReview(request) && await OrderExists(request) && !await ReviewExists(request)`) + vc-frontend `product-reviews.vue` (`feedbackAvailable = await canLeaveFeedback(...)`).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs N/A per §1a; Source + Live agree. Live caveat: the unauthenticated branch was directly observed; the purchased / already-reviewed branches rest on the same source query but were not separately re-exercised as a signed-in user.)

### BL-CR-010: The storefront review surface exposes only Approved reviews `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Every storefront-facing review read (the reviews list and its total count) is scoped server-side to `ReviewStatus = Approved` — New and Rejected reviews are never included, regardless of any client-supplied filter. The surface supports pagination and sorting by creation date.
- **Verify:** Seed a product with a mix of Approved, New, and Rejected reviews → the public query's total count and item list equal the Approved subset only. With more reviews than one page, navigate pages → each page returns the expected slice, total count stable across pages. Switch sort direction → item order reverses.
- **Violation signal:** A New or Rejected review appears in the public review list or inflates its total count; pagination returns duplicate or missing items across pages; sort direction has no effect.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (GraphQL query), qa-frontend-expert (storefront widget)
- **Docs:** PlatformUserGuide "Overview > Key features" ("You can use rating information for sorting and filtering review objects. Ratings and reviews can be displayed to users upon request.").
- **Source:** vc-module-customer-review `CustomerReviewsQueryHandler.cs` `GetSearchCriteria` — `// XAPI only operates with approved reviews`, then `criteria.ReviewStatus = [CustomerReviewStatus.Approved];`, applied unconditionally before any client filter.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs + Source + Live agree — a product's review widget rendered exactly its approved-review count, paginated and sortable.)

### BL-CR-012: Admin review search filters by status, entity type, rating range, and keyword `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** The admin review search accepts an array of review statuses, an entity type, a rating range (start/end), and a keyword, narrowing the result set to exactly the matching rows; every visible column (Title, Rating, Created date, Status, Created by) is independently sortable.
- **Verify:** In Admin, filter by Status = Approved → only Approved rows shown; filter by Status = New → only New rows shown. Filter by a rating window → each window returns only in-range rows. Sort by Created date or Rating → the list reorders accordingly.
- **Violation signal:** A status/rating-range filter leaves out-of-scope rows in the result; sorting a column has no effect; the entity-type filter has no effect.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (REST search), qa-testing-expert (Admin UI)
- **Docs:** PlatformUserGuide "Overview > Key features" ("use rating information for sorting and filtering review objects").
- **Source:** vc-module-customer-review `CustomerReviewsModuleController.cs` (`SearchCustomerReviews`, `[Authorize(CustomerReviewRead)]`) + `Core/Models/CustomerReviewSearchCriteria.cs` (`ReviewStatus[]`, `StartRating`/`EndRating`) + `CustomerReviewsQueryHandler.cs` (maps a parsed rating range onto `StartRating`/`EndRating`).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs + Source + Live agree.)

### BL-CR-013: Moderation actions transition review status and take effect immediately `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Admin moderation exposes three status-transition actions on a review — Approve (→ Approved), Reject (→ Rejected), Reset (→ New) — each of which updates the review's status and is reflected on the storefront within the same request cycle (approve makes it visible per BL-CR-010; reject/reset make it invisible).
- **Verify:** Open a New review in Admin → Approve → status becomes Approved and the review appears in the storefront's public list. Reject an Approved review → status becomes Rejected and it disappears from the storefront. Reset an Approved/Rejected review → status returns to New and it is absent from the storefront.
- **Violation signal:** A moderation action returns success but the status field is unchanged; the storefront still shows a rejected/reset review; approving does not make a review visible.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (REST endpoints), qa-testing-expert (Admin UI, end-to-end)
- **Docs:** PlatformUserGuide "Manage Reviews > Moderate reviews" ("Approve review to publish the review and include it in the rating calculation. Reject Review to exclude it from the rating calculation. The review will remain in the list with the status Rejected. Reset Review Status to change your previous decision.").
- **Source:** vc-module-customer-review `CustomerReviewsModuleController.cs` (`ApproveReview`/`RejectReview`/`ResetReviewStatus`, all `[Authorize(CustomerReviewUpdate)]`) → `CustomerReviewService.cs` (all three delegate to `ChangeReviewStatusAsync`, which persists the new status and publishes `ReviewStatusChangedEvent`).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs + Source + Live agree.)

### BL-CR-016: Product rating aggregates only Approved reviews and recomputes on status change `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The entity rating (value + review count) exposed on the storefront and via the rating API is computed exclusively from Approved reviews — New and Rejected reviews never contribute to either the average value or the count. The aggregate is recomputed whenever a review transitions status, not only on create.
- **Verify:** Read a product's rating → review count equals its Approved-review count, value is their average, both within the valid rating scale. Approve a New review for that product → rating recomputes to include it. Reject an Approved review → rating recomputes to exclude it.
- **Violation signal:** The review count includes New/Rejected reviews; the rating value falls outside the valid scale; the rating does not change after a moderation action that should affect it.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (rating API), qa-frontend-expert (storefront rating display)
- **Docs:** PlatformUserGuide "Manage Reviews > View average rating".
- **Source:** vc-module-customer-review `RatingService.cs` `Calculate` (filters the review set to Approved before grouping) + `AverageRatingCalculator.cs` (arithmetic mean) + recomputation driven by the `ReviewStatusChangedEvent` published from `ChangeReviewStatusAsync`.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs + Source + Live agree — a product page's rating summary matched its approved-review count.)

### BL-CR-017: Product reviews are a store-scoped, toggleable feature `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Whether the review widget (display + submission) appears on a store's storefront is controlled by a single store-level setting. Enabling it exposes the review widget inline in the product page body; disabling it removes the widget and its submission form entirely for that store, without affecting other stores.
- **Verify:** On a store with the setting enabled, open any product page → the review widget renders. On a store with the setting disabled, open a product page → no review widget or form renders anywhere on the page.
- **Violation signal:** The widget renders on a store where the setting is disabled; toggling the setting off leaves the widget visible until a full redeploy; enabling it on one store leaks the widget onto a different store.
- **Agents:** qa-frontend-expert (storefront rendering), qa-backend-expert (store settings)
- **Docs:** StorefrontUserGuide "Product Page Layout" ("If a reviews option is enabled for the Frontend Application, the reviews are displayed below the product description") + PlatformUserGuide "Settings > Products reviews".
- **Source:** vc-module-customer-review `ModuleConstants.cs` — `CustomerReviewsEnabled`, `GroupName = "Store|Product Reviews"`, Boolean, default false, `IsPublic = true`, store-scoped.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs + Source + Live agree.)

### BL-CR-018: Every admin review-moderation action is gated by its own named permission `[P0-security]`
- **Rule:** Each admin review-management REST action requires a distinct permission from the CustomerReviews permission group: search/list requires read; approve/reject/reset/create-or-update require update; delete requires delete; reading the aggregate rating requires the rating-read permission; triggering a store-wide rating recalculation requires the rating-recalculate permission. A caller lacking the specific permission for an action receives HTTP 403, regardless of whether they hold other CustomerReviews permissions.
- **Verify:** With a token holding only the read permission, call search → succeeds; call approve/reject/reset/delete/recalculate → each returns 403. With a token holding no CustomerReviews permissions, every one of these endpoints returns 403.
- **Violation signal:** An action succeeds for a caller who holds only a different CustomerReviews permission (e.g. a read-only token can approve); any of these endpoints is reachable with no permission at all.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (REST endpoints, RBAC)
- **Docs:** N/A — the specific permission-to-endpoint mapping is an implementation detail (§1a); the general RBAC model is documented but not per-module.
- **Source:** vc-module-customer-review `Core/ModuleConstants.cs` (the five `customerReviews:*` permission constants) + `CustomerReviewsModuleController.cs` and `CustomerReviewsModuleRatingController.cs` (`[Authorize(...)]` on every admin endpoint).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs N/A per §1a; Source + Live agree — the Admin role-assignment panel lists exactly these five permissions.)

## Domain 23: Platform Administration (BL-PLAT)

> Added 2026-08-24 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24). 92 test cases across suites `020`/`021` were citing `BL-PLAT-*` ids that did not exist (BLC-002 false traceability). The ids were confirmed free, so each entry is added at the exact cited id. **`BL-PLAT-003` is deliberately absent** — no case cites it, and the gap is real rather than an oversight.

### BL-PLAT-001: Role and permission changes take effect immediately; deleting an assigned role is safe `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** Creating, updating (including adding or removing individual permissions), or deleting a role invalidates the platform's shared security-permission cache immediately — every subsequent request evaluates the current role/permission state, and a user does not need to sign out and back in to gain or lose access after an administrator changes a role. Deleting a role that is currently assigned to one or more users must succeed (not fail with a server error) and must leave those users' accounts and remaining role assignments intact; the deleted role is simply removed from their effective role set.
- **Verify:** As an administrator, add or remove a permission on a role (or delete a role) → confirm the effect is visible on the very next request without requiring re-authentication. Separately: create a role, assign it to a user, then delete the role → deletion succeeds (no 5xx or constraint error), the user's detail view opens normally afterward, and the deleted role no longer appears in that user's role list while other assigned roles are unaffected.
- **Violation signal:** A removed permission or a deleted role's effect is visible only after the affected user signs out and back in (stale cache); deleting a role currently assigned to a user returns a server error, or the user's role list is corrupted or blanked afterward.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA Security → Roles/Users, security cache), qa-testing-expert (role CRUD verification)
- **Docs:** PlatformDeveloperGuide "Authorization in Virto Commerce" — a role is "a collection of permissions… You can redefine a role by changing its permissions".
- **Source:** vc-platform `src/VirtoCommerce.Platform.Security/CustomRoleManager.cs` — `CreateAsync`, `UpdateInternalAsync` and `DeleteAsync` each call `SecurityCacheRegion.ExpireRegion()` on success, invalidating cached role/permission lookups platform-wide on every role mutation.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry at a cited id. Docs + Source + Live agree.)

### BL-PLAT-002: Account lock or deletion is authoritative over every credential and session tied to it `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** A user's Locked or Deleted account state overrides every authentication surface bound to that account, regardless of that credential's own individual flag. An API key's own active flag is not sufficient to authenticate — the owning account must also exist, be allowed to sign in, and not be locked out; a locked or deleted owning account causes API-key authentication to fail even though the key itself is active. Locking (setting a non-empty lockout end) or deleting a user account immediately terminates every active session and token issued to that account — a currently-signed-in session does not survive an administrator locking or deleting the account.
- **Verify:** Generate an active API key for a test user → confirm it authenticates. Lock the user's account → the same active key now fails authentication. Delete the account → the key fails authentication. Separately: sign in as a test user in one session, then as an administrator lock (or delete) that account from a second session → the first session's tokens are revoked and further requests are rejected.
- **Violation signal:** An active API key still authenticates after its owning account is locked or deleted; a signed-in user's session or token remains valid after an administrator locks or deletes their account.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA Security → Users, API-key widget, REST auth), qa-testing-expert (lock/unlock + API-key interaction)
- **Docs:** PlatformDeveloperGuide API Key Authentication — "each API key must be associated with a user account, as all requests with an API key will be authorized on behalf of the user"; Passwords Management — lockout duration is configurable.
- **Source:** vc-platform `src/VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web/Security/Authentication/ApiKeyAuthenticationHandler.cs` `HandleAuthenticateAsync()` — after resolving an active key it still calls `FindByIdAsync`, `CanSignInAsync(user)` and `IsLockedOutAsync(user)`, failing authentication on any of those checks; `src/VirtoCommerce.Platform.Security/Handlers/RevokeTokenUserChangedEventHandler.cs` `Handle()` — on a `UserChangedEvent`, revokes all sessions via `TerminateAllUserSessions` whenever `LockoutEnd` becomes non-empty or the entry is Deleted.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs + Source agree and are dispositive; the live axis rests on a previously-captured lock/unlock verification of the same mechanism rather than a fresh run — re-exercise on the next pass.)

### BL-PLAT-004: A dynamic property's value type governs which capabilities it may declare `[P2-ux]`
- **Rule:** A dynamic property is defined against exactly one object type and becomes available, by that definition alone, on every entity instance of that type that implements the dynamic-properties contract — no separate per-instance registration step is required. Each property's declared value type (short text, long text, HTML, decimal, integer, boolean, date-time, measure, …) determines which structural capabilities it may legally combine: only value types whose registered capability allows it may be flagged as an array, a dictionary, or multilingual — boolean and date-time support none of the three, while short text supports all three.
- **Verify:** Define a new dynamic property against a given entity type with a chosen value type → open any existing entity of that type → the property is present and editable without further setup. Attempt to combine an unsupported capability with a value type not registered to support it (e.g. mark a boolean property as a dictionary or multilingual) → the option is unavailable or rejected. Enter a value matching the declared value type → persists and round-trips; enter a value of the wrong shape → rejected.
- **Violation signal:** A property defined for one object type fails to appear on an entity of that type without extra steps; an unsupported value-type/capability combination is accepted by the UI or the API; a value that does not match the declared value type is silently accepted.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA Dynamic Properties module, per-entity widgets, REST dynamic-property APIs)
- **Docs:** PlatformDeveloperGuide "Manage Dynamic Properties" overview + value-type selection table + the `useDynamicProperties` composable (dictionary properties, multi-language support, multi-value properties, type safety).
- **Source:** vc-platform `src/VirtoCommerce.Platform.Core/DynamicProperties/DynamicProperty.cs` (`ObjectType`, `ValueType`, `IsArray`, `IsDictionary`, `IsMultilingual`) + `DynamicPropertyValueTypeCapabilities.cs` — the static capability registry (boolean and date-time declare no array/dictionary/localization support; short text declares all three).
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs + Source + Live agree. **Scope note:** strongly grounded for the homogeneous value-type-validation citation cluster; a minority of citations in the users/roles suite (healthcheck, YAML override, login background, price validation) are a loose fit and warrant a `/qa-review-tests --fix` citation review rather than a broader rule.)

## Domain 24: Store Management (BL-STORE)

> Added 2026-08-24 (BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24). 69 test cases across suites `034`/`035` were citing `BL-STORE-*` ids that did not exist (BLC-002). Only `BL-STORE-001` cleared the evidence bar. **`BL-STORE-002` was declined outright** — its sole citing case asserts plain CRUD, and the one plausible invariant behind it (a default language must remain within the store's available-languages list) is *refuted* by source: the store validator constrains only the store id and declares no cross-field rule. `BL-STORE-003` and `BL-STORE-004` are evidenced on docs alone and are staged in `reports/ba/bl-proposals-2026-08-24.md`.

### BL-STORE-001: Store configuration is independent per store, keyed by store id `[P1-data]`
- **Rule:** The platform supports any number of stores, and each store's configuration — languages, currencies, default language and currency, catalog assignment, storefront URLs, SEO link type, tax/rounding/anonymous-access/email-verification policy, feature toggles, aggregation properties and module settings — is stored against that store's own id and resolved independently of every other store. Changing a setting on one store does not alter another store's configuration or storefront behaviour, even when both stores share the same platform instance, module set, or catalog.
- **Verify:** Open two different stores in the Admin store list → confirm each shows its own independent value for a shared-shape field (default language, SEO link type, or a feature toggle). Change a setting on the first store and save → reopen the second → its value for the same setting is unchanged. Query the storefront xAPI store query for two different store ids → each returns its own settings block.
- **Violation signal:** A setting change on one store is visible on another store's storefront or Admin blade; the store query returns identical settings for two differently-configured store ids; a newly created store inherits a setting value from another store rather than a documented default.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (Admin SPA Stores module, xAPI store query), qa-frontend-expert (multi-store storefront behaviour)
- **Docs:** PlatformUserGuide "Getting Started" — the platform "is multi-language, multi-currency, multi-theme, and multi-store… allows users to operate multiple stores seamlessly"; "General Guidelines" — store-specific (tenant) settings "must be configured within the settings of the corresponding store".
- **Source:** vc-module-store `src/VirtoCommerce.StoreModule.Core/Model/Store.cs` — every store-level field (`Languages`, `Currencies`, `DefaultLanguage`, `DefaultCurrency`, `Catalog`, `Url`, `SecureUrl`, `Settings` via `IHasSettings`, `DynamicProperties`) is a property on the per-instance `Store` entity, not a shared or global record.
- **Amended:** 2026-08-24 (auto-applied, triangulated — BL-AUDIT-2026-08-24; MISSING → new entry. Docs + Source + Live agree — multiple independently-configured stores coexist on one platform instance, each exposing its own settings.)
