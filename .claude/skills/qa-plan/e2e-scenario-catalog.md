# Comprehensive E2E Scenario Catalog

> Reference file for test-management-specialist agent. Read when creating test cases for any feature domain.

This catalog provides end-to-end test scenarios across the platform's business domains. **Counts are derived, not transcribed** — `grep -oE '\bE2E-[A-Z]+(-[A-Z]+)?-[0-9]{3}\b' <this file> | sort -u | wc -l`. It said **105** until 2026-09-11 while its own per-domain column summed to 101 and the body held 101 ids. Use these as the foundation when creating test cases for any feature.

**How to use this catalog:**
1. Identify which domain(s) a feature touches
2. Select relevant scenarios from each domain
3. Expand each scenario into detailed test cases (using the Test Case Template in the agent)
4. Add domain-specific edge cases discovered during UI exploration
5. Map scenarios to regression suites for traceability
