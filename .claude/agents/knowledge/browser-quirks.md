# Browser Quirks — Cross-Browser Testing Reference

## iOS Safari

- `100vh` includes toolbar — use `dvh` (dynamic viewport height) instead
- Fixed positioning breaks during keyboard open
- Momentum scroll traps — elements can "trap" touch scrolling
- Safe area insets needed for notch devices
- Auto-zoom on inputs with font-size < 16px — always verify mobile form inputs

## Safari Desktop

- `<input type="date">` renders native picker differently than Chrome
- `backdrop-filter` has performance issues
- `position: sticky` inside overflow containers may break

## Firefox

- Scrollbar styling: `::-webkit-scrollbar` not supported (use `scrollbar-width` / `scrollbar-color`)
- Subgrid support varies
- `gap` may not work in older flexbox contexts

## Edge

- Generally Chrome-compatible (Chromium-based)
- Extension-injected console noise — filter out `extension://` messages
- **High-contrast mode** (Edge/Windows): Verify components remain usable, borders visible, focus indicators work

## WebKit — NOT Available on Windows

WebKit is not available on Windows via Playwright. Use Edge or Chrome as fallback. Do not attempt WebKit installation.
