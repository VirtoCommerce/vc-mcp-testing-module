/**
 * validate-missions-data.mjs — STATIC drift guard for the VCST-5319 Loyalty Missions fixtures.
 * `npm run td:validate:missions`. No network, no env, no auth — safe in CI.
 *
 * It answers one question: **can this fixture set still FAIL a test?**
 *
 * Existence is not the interesting property here. Every mission in this set is defined by a value that
 * looks arbitrary and is not — `public=false`, a target of 0, a reward of 0, a null currency, an
 * `all` flag that must disagree with its twin. Change any of them to something "more sensible" and the
 * fixture still seeds, still resolves through `@td()`, and still passes — while proving nothing. So the
 * checks below are written against the ways each fixture can survive while going vacuous, plus the two
 * mechanical rules the multi-env policy turns on: no runtime GUID in a committed file, and no per-env
 * value pinned in the base alias registry.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   [1] the spec set is coherent and still discriminating   (missions-specs.validateSpecShape)
 *   [2] every spec has a registered alias, and vice versa   (no orphan either way)
 *   [3] each alias mirrors its spec's business fields       (the registry cannot drift from the source)
 *   [4] no runtime GUID / per-env value in the BASE registry (they belong to aliases.<env>.json)
 *   [5] every alias declares its runtime fields in `fields`  (else the overlay can never reach them)
 *   [6] the gate alias names the real setting + records the base switch it must NOT touch
 *   [7] no committed file anywhere carries a seeded mission GUID
 *   [8] (informational) which envs' overlays currently carry ids
 *   [9] the VCST-5346 progress axis: the provisioning order's registry entry matches the order the
 *       seeder places, the account it is placed for is a declared user-roles.mjs role, and all THREE
 *       storefront states (danger badge / partial / completed-PerSku) are still reachable
 *  [10] the targeting axis, across registries: the group the fixtures target is the group the intended
 *       member account really carries, and the negative control is declared OUTSIDE it
