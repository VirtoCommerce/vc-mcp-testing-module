/**
 * validate-missions-e2e-data.mjs — the drift + VACUITY guard for the suite-083d fixture set.
 * `npm run td:validate:missions-e2e`
 *
 * STATIC by construction: it reads the committed `test-data/aliases.json`, the per-env
 * `test-data/aliases.<env>.json` overlay and the side-effect-free spec module. No network, no auth —
 * same discipline as every other `td:validate:*` (the live half is `td:reconcile`).
 *
 * IT IS A VACUITY GUARD FIRST AND A DRIFT GUARD SECOND, and that ordering is the point.
 * A conventional drift guard asks "is the fixture still there?". Every fixture 083d needed WAS still
 * there on 2026-08-28, and six of eight cases were BLOCKED anyway, because the fixtures had been
 * CONSUMED: MSN_ORDERCOUNT sat at 2 of 2 Completed, MSN_ORDERVALUE at 100%, and a Completed mission
 * stops accruing entirely. Nothing in the repo could see that. So the checks that matter here ask
 * whether the data is still capable of failing:
 *
 *   [4] every mission was PRE-COMPLETION when it was seeded  (the missing check)
 *   [5] every mission name carries THIS run's handle          (per-run minting actually happened)
 *   [6] the reward account's balance is below the reward      (MSN-E2E-004's thesis is demonstrable)
 *   [7] the PTS target settles in a currency the denomination product does not (MSN-E2E-007 asks something)
 *   [8] pack size 1 on every target                           (a stepper can reach exactly 1)
 *
 * Exit 0 clean, 1 on any problem. Warnings never fail.
