/**
 * seed-loyalty-missions.mjs — VCST-5319 Loyalty Missions fixture seeder.
 *
 * Provisions the mission fixtures declared in `missions-specs.mjs` (the single source of truth),
 * their PerSku SKU targets, and the `Loyalty.Missions.Enable` store setting that gates the whole
 * feature. Runtime GUIDs land in `test-data/aliases.<env>.json`; nothing server-assigned is ever
 * written to a committed file.
 *
 * API (VirtoCommerce.Loyalty 3.1006.0-pr-14 — /docs/VirtoCommerce.Loyalty/swagger.json):
 *   GET    /api/loyalty-missions/new                 → a valid empty LoyaltyMission (the template)
 *   POST   /api/loyalty-missions/search              → { totalCount, results }
 *   POST   /api/loyalty-missions                     → create (accepts status Published directly)
 *   GET    /api/loyalty-missions/{id}                → one mission (200 + null body when absent)
 *   DELETE /api/loyalty-missions?ids=…               → allowed at EVERY status, incl. Published
 *   POST   /api/loyalty-mission-goal-items/search    → PerSku targets by missionId
 *   POST   /api/loyalty-mission-goal-items           → create one target
 *   PUT    /api/loyalty-mission-goal-items           → update one target
 *   DELETE /api/loyalty-mission-goal-items?ids=…     → remove targets
 *   GET/PUT /api/stores/{id}                         → store settings live on the store body
 *   POST   /api/assets?folderUrl=…                   → multipart banner upload (SVG accepted)
 *   GET    /api/assets?folderUrl=…                   → folder listing; the source of the asset URL
 *   DELETE /api/assets?urls=…                        → remove an asset by its RELATIVE url
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY — why it deletes rather than repairs.
 * A Published mission is IMMUTABLE: `EnsureMutableAsync` rejects every edit except the single
 * transition Published -> Archived, and rejects everything on an Archived one. So there is no
 * repair-in-place path for any Published fixture. The seeder instead compares a STRUCTURAL
 * SIGNATURE (`missionSignature`, deliberately date-free) plus a live window check, and on any drift
 * DELETEs and recreates. DELETE works at every status, which is what makes that safe. A mission whose
 * signature matches and whose window is open is reused untouched, so its GUID — and therefore every
 * `@td(MSN_*.id)` already resolved against it — stays stable across re-seeds.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/seed-data/loyalty/seed-loyalty-missions.mjs
 *   node scripts/seed-data/loyalty/seed-loyalty-missions.mjs --only MSN_PERSKU_ALL
 *   node scripts/seed-data/loyalty/seed-loyalty-missions.mjs --dry-run --verbose
 *   node scripts/seed-data/loyalty/seed-loyalty-missions.mjs --teardown
 *   node scripts/seed-data/loyalty/seed-loyalty-missions.mjs --missions off   # toggle-test helper
 *   node scripts/seed-data/loyalty/seed-loyalty-missions.mjs --missions on
 *   node scripts/seed-data/loyalty/seed-loyalty-missions.mjs --reupload-banners  # artwork edited
 *
 * PROGRESS (VCST-5346). Mission DEFINITIONS alone render a page of identical 0% / warning /
 * not-completed cards, because the storefront draws every visual state from `loyaltyMissionProgress`.
 * Progress has no write API on this build — `/api/loyalty-mission-progress` is search+get, and the one
 * writer is `LoyaltyMissionHandler : IEventHandler<OrderChangedEvent>` filtered to `EntryState.Added`.
 * There is no order-STATUS gate, so this seeder provisions the states with ONE Swagger-shaped order
 * (`POST /api/order/customerOrders`, status New) for the `USER` role's SECURITY-ACCOUNT id, and then
 * asserts the result twice: through the admin progress search, and through `loyaltyMissionProgress`
 * itself — the only surface that reports `daysRemaining`, which is computed per request and never
 * stored. A re-provision recreates the WHOLE mission set (a progress row cannot be reset, and one
 * order contributes to one mission once); it only happens when the live state does not already match.
 *
 * GROUP TARGETING. Two fixtures (MSN_GROUP_VIP / MSN_GROUP_VIP_PRIVATE) carry a real
 * `UserGroupIsCondition`, and the seeder resolves BOTH audience accounts live before writing anything:
 * the member must be in the target group and the non-member must NOT be, compared the way the server
 * compares (whole-string, OrdinalIgnoreCase). Either check failing ABORTS the seed — a targeted fixture
 * whose audience nobody belongs to seeds cleanly and can only ever report an absence that reads as a
 * product defect. The OBSERVED group lists go to the overlay as MSN_GROUP_AUDIENCE; the accounts
 * themselves belong to the loyalty user seeder and are never created or deleted here.
 *
 * BANNERS. Each mission carries the artwork for its GOAL TYPE (money / repeat orders / featured SKUs),
 * uploaded from `test-data/uploads/msn-banner-*.svg` under a FIXED file name so the asset URL is stable
 * across runs — it is part of `missionSignature`, and a churning URL would recreate every mission on
 * every seed. The URL is per-env and goes to the overlay; `bannerUrl` is set at CREATE time because a
 * Published mission can never gain one afterwards, and each URL is asserted to serve 2xx + image/*.

 * fixtures: `LoyaltyMissionProgress` rows have no delete API on this build, so recreating a mission
 * mints a fresh GUID and ORPHANS every progress row against a dead mission id — and the only way back

 * silence the drift — the run still says which fixture is wrong and why, it just refuses to be the

/* ── Progress provisioning (VCST-5346) ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The storefront's mission card renders PROGRESS, and progress has no write API on this build: the
 * only writer is `LoyaltyMissionHandler : IEventHandler<OrderChangedEvent>` filtered to
 * `EntryState.Added`, which enqueues `ProcessOrderAsync` on Hangfire. There is no order-STATUS gate,
 * so a plain `POST /api/order/customerOrders` provisions it — no cart, no checkout, no payment, no
 * browser. Everything here exists to make that one order produce a deterministic set of states.
 *
 * WHY A RE-PROVISION DELETES AND RECREATES *EVERY* MISSION, not just the ones whose state is wrong.
 * A given order contributes to a given mission exactly once (`TransactionExistsAsync(missionId,
 * orderId, userId)` plus a unique index), and a progress row cannot be deleted, edited or reset
 * through any API. So the only way back to a known progress state is a mission with a NEW id — at
 * which point a fresh order must be placed for it. But that fresh order also lands on every OTHER
 * mission that still carries progress from the previous order, adding a second contribution and
 * silently pushing e.g. MSN_ORDERCOUNT from 1/2 to 2/2. Recreating the whole set makes the resulting
 * progress a pure function of (the spec set) x (one order) instead of of the run history. It is a big
 * hammer, so it only swings when the live state does NOT already match: on an unchanged env the
 * seeder reuses everything and touches nothing.

  // 2026-09-01:
  //
  //   - The scoped form was written `ids: [...]`. The schema field is `documentIds` (IndexingOptions:
  //     documentType, documentIds, deleteExistingIndex, startDate, endDate, batchSize), so `ids` was
  //     silently dropped and what actually ran was a bare incremental — which is why "scoped" and
  //     "incremental" looked indistinguishable.
  //   - `CatalogProduct` is NOT a registered document type on this platform. `GET /api/search/indexes`
  //     registers `Product`, `Category`, `ContentFile`, `Member`, `PickupLocation`, `Pages`,
  //     `CustomerOrder`. A `CatalogProduct` request is accepted (HTTP 200 + a real jobId) and indexes
  //     nothing, which is what produced the `totalCount: 0, processedCount: 0` counters below and the
  //     conclusion that "the incremental indexer processed zero documents". It processed zero
  //     documents because it was addressed to an indexer that does not exist.
  //
  // Re-measured directly: a freshly created product triggered with `CatalogProduct` was still
  // unindexed after 120 s; the same product triggered with `{ documentType: 'Product', documentIds:
  // [id] }` was indexed in under 6 s. A full `rebuild: true` is still deliberately never issued — on
