/**
 * scripts/seed-data/sales-rep/sales-rep-demo-specs.mjs
 *
 * The DEMO sales-rep dataset — declarations and derivations, side-effect free. No env reads, no
 * network, no `main()`, so the seeder, the drift guard and the unit tests all import ONE source of
 * truth rather than three drifting copies.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE FIXTURE FAMILY. The AGENT-TEST fixtures are built to be
 * findable: the family prefix rides every display name, which is exactly what makes teardown a
 * one-line keyword sweep. A demo inverts that requirement — the data has to read as a real
 * business, so `AGENT-TEST-Org-AcmeCorp-20260310` and `AGENT-TEST Buyer` are disqualifying. The
 * prefix is not decoration here; it IS the delete mechanism, so removing it means replacing it:
 *
 *   1. A HIDDEN MARKER in `outerId` on every globally-enumerable entity. `outerId` is on the model
 *      (Member and CustomerOrder are IHasOuterId), it is metadata for "this came from an external
 *      system", and no storefront fragment or Admin grid column renders it. This is the same move
 *      `b2b/addresses-specs.mjs` already makes, and for the same reason.
 *   2. AN ID LEDGER in `test-data/aliases.<env>.json`, because two entity types have NO hidden
 *      field at all: a sales-rep document's create body is closed (`fileId/category/name/summary/
 *      pageCount/previewUrl`) and every one of those renders, and a task's five inputs are all
 *      list, filter or detail fields. For those the ledger is the only teardown handle.
 *
 * Neither layer is sufficient alone: a ledger cannot survive an interrupted run or a reverted
 * overlay, and a marker cannot reach a document. Teardown reads the ledger first and sweeps by
 * marker for orphans.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DATASET CANNOT DO. `createdDate` is server-assigned and silently ignored on POST and
 * PUT (see sales-rep-orders-specs.mjs), so demo order history CANNOT be backdated. The narrative is
 * therefore "a day in the life of two reps" rather than "this quarter" — which also makes every
 * placed-today / new-this-week dashboard counter read non-zero, a better demo than an empty widget.
 * Relative recency is controlled the only way it can be: POST order, latest last.
 *
 * NO CATALOG ENTITIES ARE DECLARED HERE, deliberately. Products come from live discovery
 * (`discoverCatalogProducts`), never from a hardcoded SKU. That also keeps `td:reconcile` check [7]
 * — which audits AGENT-TEST prefixes on seed-catalog entities — a non-issue by construction rather
 * than by exemption.
