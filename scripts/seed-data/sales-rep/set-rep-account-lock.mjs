/**
 * set-rep-account-lock.mjs — lock / unlock a sales-rep's PLATFORM ACCOUNT mid-session (VCST-5733 #21).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * vc-module-sales-rep PR #14 wires `EnsureAuthenticatedAsync` → `IUserManagerCore.CheckCurrentUserState`
 * into `SalesRepQueryBuilder.BeforeMediatorSend`, so EVERY sales-rep GraphQL query re-checks the
 * caller's account state at QUERY time instead of trusting the token's claims. Before that change a
 * locked account kept working until its token expired (~30 min), and an `OrganizationMembership`
 * lock — which is what `SR_REP_LOCKED` carries — is a MEMBERSHIP lock, not an account lock, so it
 * never exercised this gate either.
 *
 * The gate is unreachable from a statically-locked fixture. `SR_REP_BLOCKED` is locked at rest, so
 * `POST /connect/token` refuses it outright (400) and the GraphQL layer is never entered: the refusal
 * proves the TOKEN endpoint works, not the query-time re-check. The only way in is a state
 * TRANSITION — a token issued while the account was healthy, then used after it was locked:
 *
 *   1. POST /connect/token as @td(SR_REP_LOCKABLE.email)          -> a valid access token
 *   2. TEST_ENV=<env> npm run sr:lock                             -> the account is now locked
 *   3. re-issue the sales-rep query on the SAME still-valid token -> expect the state refusal
 *   4. TEST_ENV=<env> npm run sr:unlock                           -> back to the resting state
 *
 * `vc-module-x-api` PR #84 memoizes `CheckUserState` per REQUEST (it caches the verdict, keyed on
 * userId + flags), so the lock is observed on the NEXT request rather than part-way through one.
 * A case must therefore issue a FRESH request after step 2, not merely select another root field.
 *
 * SAFETY — the allowlist is the point, not a formality
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Locking a shared rep locks every suite that authenticates as it out of the environment, and the
 * symptom (a 400 at `/connect/token`) looks nothing like the cause. So this script refuses every rep
 * except the ones declared LOCKABLE below. In particular it refuses `SR_REP_PRIMARY`: ~40 cases in
 * 050m/089/091/093 authenticate as it, and this fixture set's own three order aliases are attributed
 * to its account id.
 *
 * TEARDOWN IS AUTOMATIC, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * A lock left behind by an interrupted run is exactly the residue that poisons a later suite, and an
 * `--unlock` that only runs on the happy path is not a teardown. So the resting state is enforced by
 * the ORDINARY seeder: `SR_REP_LOCKABLE` has `is_locked=false`, so `repFixtureStatus()` is `Approved`,
 * so `seed-sales-rep.mjs`'s `clearRepStaleLockout()` → `hasStaleLockout()` clears `lockoutEnd` and
 * `accessFailedCount` on EVERY reseed. `npm run sr:unlock` is the fast path; a plain
 * `npm run seed:sales-rep` is the backstop, and `--verify` reports the current state without writing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   TEST_ENV=vcst node scripts/seed-data/sales-rep/set-rep-account-lock.mjs --lock   [--rep SR_REP_LOCKABLE]
 *   TEST_ENV=vcst node scripts/seed-data/sales-rep/set-rep-account-lock.mjs --unlock [--rep SR_REP_LOCKABLE]
 *   TEST_ENV=vcst node scripts/seed-data/sales-rep/set-rep-account-lock.mjs --verify [--rep SR_REP_LOCKABLE]
