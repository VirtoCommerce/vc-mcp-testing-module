 * browser lanes, in either order, or one without the other (`smoke` runs 042 and
 * not 029). So "Admin logged in (BSM-001 passed)" written in a suite that does
 * NOT contain BSM-001 is not a precondition at all — it is a wish. The case runs
 * with whatever state the lane happens to hold, and the failure surfaces as a
 * BLOCKED or, worse, as a pass that depended on luck.
 *
 * `check-smoke-gates.ts` structurally cannot catch this: it builds its case-ID
 * set as the UNION of the sibling CSVs in a directory, precisely so a checklist
 * can span them — which means a reference from one sibling into another passes
 * SG-001 as valid. This rule is the dual of `findDuplicateCaseIds` above: that
 * one says an ID belongs to exactly one file, this one says a DEPENDENCY may not
 * leave it.
 *
 * A token is only treated as a reference when it resolves to a real case ID
 * somewhere in the corpus, so prose that merely looks like an ID (`BL-AUTH-005`,
 * `ECL-13.2`, `VCST-5089`) can never produce a false positive.
 *
 * Rows are read BY HEADER NAME, never by position: 11 suites still carry a
 * legacy 11-column header, and a positional read would silently score their
 * `Expected Result` column as `Preconditions`.

 * `[ACT]` ALONE IS NOT THE SIGNAL. The tag is overloaded: in a storefront suite it means
 * click/fill (`test-runner-tags.md` maps it to browser_click/fill/select), but in an API suite
 * it means "perform this HTTP request" — suite 049 (Platform API) has 37 `[ACT]` lines and
 * every one of them is a REST call (`[ACT] POST {{BACK_URL}}/api/pricing/evaluate ...`).
 * A bare presence test therefore marks the whole API layer click-driven and needlessly bars it
 * from a perfectly usable firefox lane. The recorded run REG-2026-08-24-1806 has a human
 * making exactly this call by hand and getting it right: suite 049 on firefox, noted
 * "REST/HTTP tags only, no clicking - safe on firefox". This derivation must agree with them.
 *
 * So: an `[ACT]` line counts only when it reads as a UI interaction and NOT as an HTTP call.
 * `[PRE:*]` primitives that drive the UI (sign-in, org switch, cart reset, sign-out) count
 * unconditionally — those always click.
 *
 * Returns null when the CSV cannot be read, so the declared value is kept rather than cleared
 * — same discipline as `actualCaseCount`.
