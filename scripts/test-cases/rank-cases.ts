/**
 * Rank test cases by how much detection they buy for what they cost.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The corpus grows every day and a full regression runs for hours, but a large
 * share of it buys nothing: many cases carry no assertion that can fail on a
 * wrong value, and most Frontend cases are long walkthroughs. That combination
 * is the worst possible trade — maximum cost to run, near-zero probability of
 * catching anything, because a presence check only fails when an element is
 * absent entirely. This script REPORTS the current numbers rather than quoting
 * them: the first version transcribed a measurement that the next commit
 * corrected, and it went stale in four places at once.
 *
 * This script makes that trade VISIBLE per case, with a reason for every verdict.
 * It deliberately prints reasons rather than a bare score: Google deployed a
 * bug-prediction score company-wide and measured no change in behaviour (Lewis
 * et al., ICSE 2013) — an unexplained number gets ignored, so the output has to
 * say WHY a case is weak and what would fix it.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT
 * --------------
 * It is not a yield measurement. "Has this case ever caught a bug?" is still not
 * computable here: history.json is suite-granular, its `bugs_found` is empty in
 * every row, and per-case `durationMs` is written by the runner then discarded at
 * fold. So this ranks by assertion STRENGTH and STEP COST — properties of the
 * case text — and says so. When per-case history lands, `yield` becomes a fourth
 * signal; until then no verdict here claims a case is dead, only that it cannot
 * discriminate.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED, in the expensive direction
 * ---------------------------------------
 * A wrongly demoted case silently removes coverage; a wrongly kept one costs
 * minutes. So every doubt resolves to KEEP, and DEMOTE requires ALL of:
 * presence-only assertions AND >=6 steps AND not on the risk floor AND no
 * deliberate design stamp. Anything cheap, high-priority or deliberately
 * designed is STRENGTHEN (fix the assertion) — never DEMOTE.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/test-cases/rank-cases.ts [--suite <csv>] [--layer frontend|backend]
 *                                            [--verdict DEMOTE|STRENGTHEN|KEEP] [--json] [--limit N]
