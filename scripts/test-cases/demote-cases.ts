/**
 * Demote presence-only, expensive cases OUT of the regression lane.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `promote-cases.ts` is a one-way ratchet — its own header says it "never
 * demotes". The consequence is measurable: 3 cases out of 4,243 carry
 * `Deprecated`, and nothing else has ever left the lane. Meanwhile a full
 * regression is many hours of wall clock and a large share of the corpus cannot
 * fail on a wrong value, so much of that budget buys checks that only fail when
 * an element is missing entirely. `npm run tc:rank` reports the current share;
 * no figure is transcribed here, because the first version quoted one that the
 * very next commit invalidated.
 *
 * This is the missing counterpart. It is deliberately the WEAKEST possible
 * intervention that still stops the bleeding.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT DO
 * ----------------------------
 *   - Writes `Automation_Status` -> `Manual` ONLY. A demoted case stays in the
 *     file, keeps its ID, keeps its history, and a human can put it straight
 *     back. `Manual` is already an EX-200 opt-out in `case-classifier.ts`, so it
 *     immediately stops consuming regression time with no runner change.
 *   - NEVER writes `Deprecated`. That is the repo's own rule (TRI-006:
 *     "Deprecation is destructive … so it is ALWAYS human") and this script has
 *     no business overriding it — `Deprecated` means "nobody runs this ever",
 *     which is a claim about the product, not about the assertion text.
 *   - NEVER deletes a row, and never touches Steps or Assertions. Strengthening
 *     an assertion needs to know the correct value; that is authoring work for
 *     `/qa-test-cases-generator`, not a bulk edit.
 *   - Requires `--confirm` to write. Default is a dry run.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED, in the expensive direction
 * ---------------------------------------
 * A wrong demotion silently removes coverage; a wrong keep costs minutes. So the
 * bar is `rank-cases.ts`'s DEMOTE verdict, which already requires ALL of:
 * presence-only assertions, >= 6 steps, not on the risk floor (Critical/P0), and
 * no deliberate `Archetype:` stamp. Anything cheap, critical or deliberately
 * designed comes back STRENGTHEN and is never touched here.
 *
 * The write itself reuses `promote-cases.ts` `applyCellEdits`, which edits only
 * the bytes of the changed cells and then re-parses and compares every field —
 * so a re-serialisation cannot silently renormalise the quoting of untouched
 * rows. Measured on promote: 39 edits produced exactly 39 insertions and 39
 * deletions.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/test-cases/demote-cases.ts [--suite <csv>] [--layer frontend] [--limit N]
 *   npx tsx scripts/test-cases/demote-cases.ts --suite <csv> --confirm
