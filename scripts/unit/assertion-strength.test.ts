// Unit tests for the T-006 assertion-strength classifier
// (scripts/test-cases/lint-test-cases.ts).
//
// Why this rule exists: measured on this corpus, 1,044 of 1,961 Frontend cases
// (53%) asserted only presence, and a presence check fails only when the element
// is absent entirely — the rarest failure mode. Real bugs render SOMETHING (the
// open bug `non-usd-price-zero-display` renders a literal `£0.00`, so "price is
// visible" passes).
//
// The classifier has to get TWO directions right, and the second is what stops it
// becoming noise: it must flag presence-only cases, and it must NOT flag the
// measurable ones that already exist (048c) or the value-comparing ones
// (CAT-AURL-001). A rule that hits correct cases gets switched off.
// Run: `npx tsx --test scripts/unit/assertion-strength.test.ts` / `npm test`.
