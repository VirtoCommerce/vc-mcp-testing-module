// Unit tests for ci/lib/run-plan.ts and ci/lib/suite-manifest.ts — the plan the interactive
// orchestrator follows.
//
// This is the load-bearing test for the INTERACTIVE regression path. That path is driven by
// `/qa-regression`, which dispatches sub-agents from inside a Claude Code session — no API key,
// no Docker, no `ci/run-regression.ts`. The agents follow a markdown file, so they cannot import
// the scheduling code; they run `npm run regression:plan` and follow its output. Which means the
// plan IS the contract, and it has to be right without anyone running a suite to find out.
//
// Asserted against the real manifest, not a fixture: the whole point is that the numbers
// describe the actual corpus.
//
// Run: `npx tsx --test scripts/unit/run-plan.test.ts` / `npm test`.
