 * lint-claude-docs — the context-budget gate + the generalised doc-integrity ratchet.
 *
 *   npm run context:check        exit 1 on a budget breach or a ratchet regression, 2 if a source is unreadable
 *   npm run context:report       --json
 *
 * WHY. The 2026-09-07 audit measured 432K chars (~114K tokens) of always-loaded instructions, re-paid on
 * every turn AND every subagent dispatch, growing +59K chars/week with a deletion rate of ~0. PR 2 cut it to
 * ~110K. Nothing stops it growing back except this file. `.claude/rules/` is auto-loaded by the harness, so
 * the loading tier IS the directory — which is what makes the budget measurable.
 *
 * CHECKS
 *   BUDGET-001  CLAUDE.md + .claude/rules/*.md total chars  >  BUDGET.alwaysLoadedChars          (hard)
 *   BUDGET-002  any single line in those files              >  BUDGET.longestLineChars           (hard —
 *               a 30,459-char bullet is how CLAUDE.md hid 8K tokens in one "line")
 *   BUDGET-003  a SKILL.md body over ~5k tokens (Anthropic's verified Level-2 guidance)           (informational)
 *   DOC-002     `npm run <script>` with no such script in package.json                             (ratchet)
 *   DOC-003     a cited repo path that does not exist                                              (ratchet)
 *   DOC-004     a cited `file.md` … §Section with no such heading in that file                    (ratchet)
 *   DOC-006     a DERIVED count (suites / test cases / selection groups) transcribed into the
 *               always-loaded set, where it silently rots                                        (ratchet)
 *
 * DOC-002/003/004 generalise `scripts/qa-test/doclint.mjs` (which stays scoped to /qa-test and owns the
 * qa-test-specific DOC-001/005/006) to CLAUDE.md + every .claude/**\/*.md. They are RATCHETS, same shape as
 * CSV_LINT_BASELINE / XREF_BASELINE: the count may never GROW past BASELINE; shrinking it and lowering the
 * number is the burn-down. Exclusions are structural, not a hand list: a gitignored path (runtime artifact),
 * a placeholder (`SprintXX-XX`, `<slug>`, `*`), a prefix family (`npm run seed:`), a generic script name
 * that belongs to ANOTHER repo (`build`, `dev` in vc-frontend prose).

// Ratchet baseline — measured 2026-09-08 right after PR 2. Lower a number when you fix findings; never raise one.
// All three baselines were non-zero until 2026-09-08, and none of the three numbers meant what it said.
// Each rule was comparing a citation against the wrong thing, so each carried a mix of phantom findings
// and real ones — and the phantoms are what pinned the baseline, which in turn hid the real ones.
//   DOC-002 (4)  — every finding was a line SAYING the script does not exist ("`npm run model:lint` is
//                  not implemented, do not cite it as a gate"). Now declared with `doclint:may-not-exist`.
//   DOC-003 (43) — checked the backticked LABEL against the repo root instead of the link TARGET
//                  relative to the citing file. 30 were `reports/` artifacts that are ephemeral by
//                  policy (now DOC-003E, informational); 3 real broken links had been passing.
//   DOC-004 (18) — matched the first 25 characters of a citation that runs on into the sentence around
//                  it, so `§Effort routing records that the…` missed "## Effort routing, and why…".
//                  9 were phantom, 9 were genuinely stale citations and were repointed.
// 0 is the real number for all three, and a ratchet at 0 is the only one that catches the next one.
