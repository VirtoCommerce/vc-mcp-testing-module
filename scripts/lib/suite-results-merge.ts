/**
 * Merge per-lane result fragments into the ONE canonical `suite-{ID}-results.json`.
 *
 * WHY FRAGMENTS AND A MERGER, RATHER THAN ONE SHARED FILE. Once a suite's cases are split
 * across a machine lane and a browser agent, two writers exist. The runner agent's contract
 * is "overwrite the whole file each time", so a shared file is a race — and asking an LLM to
 * preserve another writer's rows on every rewrite is a rule it will break under context
 * pressure, at which point a real failure silently disappears. So: exactly ONE writer per
 * fragment, and one deterministic merger.
 *
 *   suite-050h-results.machine.json   <- machine-lane.ts    (29 rows)
 *   suite-050h-results.browser.json   <- test-runner-agent  (4 rows)
 *           \__ merge-suite-lanes.ts __/
 *                       v
 *   suite-050h-results.json           <- canonical, 34 rows, every one tagged with its lane
 *
 * The canonical file is what `scripts/lib/regression-triage.ts` and
 * `scripts/regression/generate-regression-html-report.ts` already read, so nothing
 * downstream changes.
 *
 * THE PLAN IS AUTHORITATIVE ABOUT WHAT SHOULD EXIST. `planned` comes from the lanes file,
 * not from the fragments, because the failure worth engineering against is a lane dying
 * quietly: if the merger derived its case set from what the fragments reported, a machine
 * lane that crashed before writing would produce a smaller, greener, faster-looking suite.
 * That is the same failure shape as a dropped test, and it is the reason `lane_lost` exists.
