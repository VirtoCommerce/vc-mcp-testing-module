/**
 * suite-selection — decide WHICH suites a change needs, deterministically.
 *
 * "Not running a suite beats running it fast." Every other piece of this work made the same
 * corpus cheaper to execute (`full` 23.4 h → 14 h 15 m, `smoke` 83 → 40 min). This one asks
 * whether a given change needs the whole corpus at all: 50 of 127 suites declare
 * `requiresModules`, so a single-module PR plausibly needs a handful of suites, not 119.
 *
 * WHY IT REPLACES AN LLM. `ci/run-full-cycle.ts` asks an agent to print
 * `AFFECTED_SUITES: <ids>` and parses it with a regex (`:104` and `:113`). That has already
 * hallucinated — the `REG-2026-08-24-1806` notes carry 32 claimed new-case IDs that do not
 * exist, each one exactly the next sequential number after a real suite's maximum. A selection
 * derived from `git diff` and the manifest cannot invent a suite id, costs nothing, and gives
 * the same answer twice.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN — and note this INVERTS the rule the rest of this work follows.
 * `case-classifier.ts` fails CLOSED: any doubt routes a case to the browser lane, because
 * claiming a case is machine-ready when it is not manufactures a BLOCKED that reads as a
 * product failure. Here the expensive direction is the opposite one. Selecting a suite that
 * turns out to be irrelevant costs its `estimatedMinutes`; NOT selecting one that would have
 * caught a regression ships the regression. So:
 *
 *   - a changed path that maps to nothing WIDENS the selection, and is reported in
 *     `unmappedPaths` so the gap is visible rather than silently absorbed;
 *   - narrowing inside a repo happens only when a path segment matches the manifest's OWN
 *     vocabulary, never on a guess;
 *   - the risk floor is never trimmed, whatever the makespan target says.
 *
 * NO HAND-MAINTAINED PATH MAP. The temptation is a table from `client-app/shared/checkout/…`
 * to a suite list. That is the transcribed constant `.claude/rules/test-data.md` §GOLDEN RULE
 * forbids, and it fails silently — a renamed directory produces a narrower selection with no
 * error anywhere. Instead the path's own segments are matched against the manifest's `domain`
 * and `tags` values, so the vocabulary comes from the same file the suites do.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT PROVE. Whether a change-scoped selection catches what `full` catches is a
 * question about missed regressions, and answering it needs run history that does not exist yet
 * (`history.json` is un-ignored per A4, but no run has written one). So the history signal
 * below is a documented no-op today, and the whole selector is meant to run in shadow beside a
 * periodic `full` for several cycles before anyone trusts it as the default. Shipping it as the
 * default now would be trading a measured cost for an unmeasured risk.
 *
 * Pure: no filesystem, no git, no clock beyond what the caller injects. The CLI in
 * `scripts/regression/select-suites.ts` supplies the diff and the manifest.
