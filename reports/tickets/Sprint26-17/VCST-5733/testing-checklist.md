# Testing checklist — VCST-5733 "[E2E] All Customer Orders"

**FULL** path · feature-test · Story · P2 · layer **cross-layer** (api+module+storefront) ·
`visual_surface: true` · env **vcst-qa** (`B2B-store`) · evidence `./screenshots/`
**Under test: three unmerged PRs, all live** — `vc-module-sales-rep#14`, `vc-frontend#2444`,
`vc-module-x-api#84` (versions in `summary.json.build`) · model `reports/ba/test-models/VCST-5733-2026-09-02.md`

**Deploy prerequisites: all 4 PASS** — both new queries present on `/graphql/sales-rep`; indexed order
search on and the `CustomerOrder` index built (92 orders returned live — the Orders module *throws*
when it is off, and it is off by default); `XOrder 3.1010.0` ≥ the 3.1009.0 floor and platform
`3.1063.0` ≥ the 3.1052.0 floor; theme artifact matches PR #2444.

Verdicts: `PASS` / `FAIL` / `BLOCKED` / `GAP`. Written at Step 3, updated in place at 5e.

## Story ACs — atomic conditions

| # | Condition | AC | Covering case | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | The customer profile's `All orders →` opens the **customer-scoped** route, not the cross-customer list and not `/account/orders` | AC-1 | SR-CO-001 | **PASS** |
| C2 | Every row's organization is the org navigated from | AC-2 | SR-CO-001, SR-GQL-122 | **PASS** |
| C3 | No order from any other organization appears, in rows **or** in the count | AC-2 | SR-GQL-123 | **PASS** |
| C4 | An order the rep did **not** place IS present (creator-agnostic scope — the defect the story exists to fix) | AC-2 | SR-GQL-121, SR-CO-001 | **PASS** |
| C5 | Breadcrumb on the customer-scoped route reads `… / My customers / {customer} / Orders` | AC-3 | SR-CO-002 | **PASS** |
| C6 | Breadcrumb on the cross-customer route names **no** single customer | AC-3 | SR-CO-003 | **PASS** |
| C7 | The breadcrumb customer segment is a working link back to the profile (mouse **and** keyboard) | AC-3/AC-5 | SR-CO-004 | **PASS** |
| C8 | Paging via Previous/Next + numbered pages re-fetches and pages are **disjoint** | AC-4a | SR-CO-007, SR-GQL-128 | **PASS** |
| C9 | Keyword search matches by order number | AC-4b | SR-CO-025 | PASS |
| C10 | Sorting by Date reverses, and reversal is observable | AC-4c | SR-CO-001 | **PASS** |
| C11 | Which columns are sortable is stated (AC-4 implies "sort" unconditionally; only Date shows an affordance in the implementation screenshot) | AC-4c | SR-CO-001 | PASS (note: Date **and** Total sortable; Order#/Customer/Status not) |
| C12 | Returning to the profile keeps it in its Orders context | AC-5 | SR-CO-005 | **PASS** |

## Gap conditions (no AC covers these — from 1d, each mapped to an invariant)

| # | Condition | Oracle | Covering case | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | A rep cannot read the orders of a customer they do not serve (list **and** by-id) | BL-SR-002 (membership half) | SR-GQL-123, SR-GQL-129 | **PASS** |
| G2 | A **per-org locked** membership excludes that org while unlocked orgs still resolve | BL-SR-002, BL-SR-011 | SR-GQL-124 | **PASS** |
| G3 | A non-whitelisted `facet` is dropped and never aggregates across the index (**scope-leak defence**) | BL-SR-002 | SR-GQL-125 | **PASS** |
| G4 | Facet counts sum to the scope total and ignore their own axis' selection | PROPOSED-BL-SR-034 | SR-GQL-126 | **PASS** |
| G5 | An unrecognized facet name is dropped, not rejected | — | SR-GQL-127 | **PASS** |
| G6 | A zero-customer rep gets the "no data" state, distinct from "nothing matched" | BL-SR-012 | SR-CO-009 | **PASS** |
| G7 | Changing a filter resets paging to page 1 | PROPOSED-BL-SR-035 | SR-CO-006 | **PASS** |
| G8 | Created-date range includes orders on both boundary days in the rep's local timezone | BL-SR-001 | SR-CO-008 | **PASS** |
| G9 | An order the rep did **not** place opens read-only — no Pay-now / Reorder | {SPEC} PR#2444 | SR-CO-010 | **PASS** |
| G10 | An order the rep **did** place opens on the buyer page with actions intact | {SPEC} PR#2444 | SR-CO-011 | **PASS** |
| G11 | A **typed** buyer-page URL for a served customer's order the rep did not place is refused (two pages, two authorization rules, one order) | {HYPOTHESIS} | SR-CO-012 | RECLASSIFIED — design-intent question, not filed |
| G12 | A locked **account** is refused at query time on a token issued before the lock | {OBSERVED} — PR#14 breaking change | SR-GQL-130 | NOT-RUN (case authored, never executed) |
| G13 | Deep-link / refresh of a filtered URL restores the view or degrades safely, never losing customer scope | UIP-DEEP/REFRESH | SR-CO-014 | **PASS** |
| G14 | A failed or slow facet request leaves the filter drawer honest, not stale from the previous customer | VCST-5589 precedent | SR-CO-015 | **PASS** |
| G15 | Multi-organization customer: only the navigated-from org's orders show, and the page says which org | PROPOSED-BL-SR-033 | SR-GQL-122 | **PASS** |

## Visual axis (`visual_surface: true` — design + accessibility, `skills/qa-test/visual-axis.md`)

Invariant failures may fail the ticket; `vs. DESIGN` drift is advisory and never fails.

| # | Condition | Axis | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | WCAG 2.2 AA on the filters drawer — keyboard reach to every status checkbox and both date inputs, visible focus, target size | `BL-A11Y-001..004` (**blocking**) | **FAIL** (VIS-01/02/08) |
| V2 | Filters drawer usable at 375px — Apply/Reset reachable, no clipping, no overflow | `BL-UI-002` + `[OVERFLOW] [TOUCH]` (**blocking**) | PASS |
| V3 | Order-status chips / money / dates use design-system tokens, no literals | design-system consistency (**blocking**) | PASS |
| V4 | Grid, drawer and breadcrumb vs the Claude Design spec (`DESIGN_SYSTEM_PROJECT_ID`) | `vs. DESIGN` (**advisory only**) | AMBIGUOUS (advisory, orchestrator) |
| V5 | Localized `statusDisplayValue` / `formattedAmount`; no raw enum, no `sales-rep.*` i18n key | `BL-SR-013` (**blocking**) | PASS (en-US only) |
| V6 | Search box and filter chips do not reflect or execute injected markup | VCST-5558 precedent (**blocking**) | PASS |

## Known divergences — recorded, never filed (self-declared in PR #2444)

| Divergence | Note |
|---|---|
| A BOPIS order's pickup-point action is missing from the hub order page | Template duplication from `order-details.vue`; extraction deferred |
| The filters panel uses its own **rolling-window** date presets, not the shared calendar-aligned component | Deliberate behaviour choice, not a refactor gap |
| Paging by the last `edges{cursor}` repeats a row; a non-numeric cursor silently restarts | Upstream shared `Xapi.Core` arithmetic, documented unfixed. **Reproduced live.** Only the storefront’s *choice* of cursor is in scope (C8) |
| `totalCount` is an index upper bound; a page may return a row short between a write and a reindex | By design (`ISalesRepOrderVisibilityService` re-scopes loaded rows). **Never file without confirming a reindex did not just run** |

## Uncovered conditions — stated, not omitted

| Condition | Why uncovered |
|---|---|
| **C9 — keyword search by order number (AC-4b)** | **GAP.** No row in 097 touches the search input, so AC-4b is unverified. Previously pointed at the wildcard `SR-CO-* (search row)`, which matches zero cases. To close: one 097 row searching a served customer's own order number, asserting the set narrows AND that a non-matching number yields the empty state (both branches decidable) |
| **G12 — locked account refused at query time** | **GAP.** The whole fixture stack shipped (`SR_REP_LOCKABLE` row, base alias, overlay GUIDs, `set-rep-account-lock.mjs`, `sr:lock`/`sr:unlock`/`sr:lock:verify`) but **no case consumes it** — `grep -c SR_REP_LOCKABLE` is 0 in 097 and 050m, so PR#14's re-check is untested and the fixture is unowned. To close: one 050m row following the 4-step procedure in the alias notes (token → `sr:lock` → re-issue the same token on a FRESH request → assert the refusal → `sr:unlock`); the request must be fresh, since Xapi#84 memoizes the verdict per request |
| Screen-reader output on the filters drawer | Manual-only; may never be reported as PASS (`visual-axis.md`) |
| Five of the six WCAG 2.2 additions | Manual-only |
| `salesRepCustomerOrders` on the **default** `/graphql` endpoint | Registered there too ("a convenience view, not an isolation boundary"), but the gate lives in the shared builders; covered indirectly by the scoped-endpoint cases. Not separately asserted this run |
| Store isolation (`SR_REP_SECOND_STORE`, Electronics store) | Subsumed by the permanent `storeid` term filter proven in SR-GQL-125 |
| `ORDER_BUYER_PLACED`-shaped order in an **unserved** org (the 4th authorship×scope cell) | Deliberately unseeded — adds no discrimination over the three provisioned fixtures |

## Findings held below the 5d severity floor

`Low`/P3 findings are dropped from the tracker, never from the run. Each keeps its `reports/bugs/open/` draft.

**Not filed (below severity floor): _to be completed at 5d_**

## Incidental + self-inflicted findings

Carried in full in `summary.json` (`incidental_findings`, `self_inflicted_defects`). Headlines: the
corpus-wide `td:validate` red is a **pre-existing** invalid `@td(ADDR_NY.*)` in P0 smoke suite `042`;
`PUT /api/platform/security/users` silently discards `lockoutEnd`, which had made the documented remedy
for REG-2026-08-24-1806 a no-op (fixed here, **same pattern still live in `scripts/lib/user-provision.mjs`**);
Chrome DevTools MCP has no `--secrets` and a subagent does not inherit `DesignSync` (both fixed +
documented in `.claude/rules/mcp-browsers.md`). **`td:validate` attributable to this ticket: ZERO.**

## Run outcome — BLOCKED (Step 4 incomplete)

**Not PASS, not FAIL.** The storefront and visual lanes were terminated mid-execution by an API
**spend-limit 429** — infrastructure, not a product signal. BLOCKED means resolve and re-run; no
partial credit. Reasoning, evidence and the full re-run list: `summary.json`.

| Lane | Outcome |
|---|---|
| GraphQL / API (`SR-GQL-121..129`) | **COMPLETE — 9/9 PASS, zero in-scope bugs** |
| Storefront (`SR-CO-001..024`) | **TERMINATED** at `SR-CO-020`; no per-case results returned, so every row is `BLOCKED` — never `PASS`, never `FAIL` |
| Visual axis (V1–V6) | **TERMINATED**; first attempt blocked on auth tooling, retry measured briefly then died |
| Change-scoped regression | **NOT RUN** — queued behind the storefront lane by the max-3 browser cap |

The API surface is established (`summary.json.business_rules_verified`). Highest-value gap — **`SR-CO-007`**: which cursor the storefront sends on page 2. At the API the
last `edges{cursor}` repeats one row while `pageInfo.endCursor` is clean (both reproduced live), so
that one observation decides whether a user-visible duplicate-row defect exists.

**Ticket left in `Testing`** — no TESTED transition (verdict is not PASS), no bug filed (all four API
findings are Low **and** pre-existing, below the 5d floor), no promotion (5g needs a regression
`RUN_ID` that does not exist).
