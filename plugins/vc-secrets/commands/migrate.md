# /vc-secrets:migrate — carry existing secrets over to the namespaced keys

Keys are now namespaced by the declaration's home (`vc-secrets:<projectId>:<name>`,
`vc-secrets:user:<name>`) instead of the older flat `mcpw:<name>` credential (Credential Manager,
Keychain) or `~/.config/mcpw/secrets/<name>.gpg` (gpg, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` honoured). This copies what
is already stored under that legacy key. If this machine never ran the older launcher, there is
nothing to migrate — every secret reports `no legacy entry` and the command can be ignored.

## Why this exists rather than "just set them again"

`set` needs the plaintext, and the credential store will not hand a value back — that is the whole
point of putting it there. A developer whose PAT exists only under the old key cannot retype it; they
would have to mint a new one. Across a team, renaming a key prefix would become a credential
rotation. So the launcher reads the old entry itself and writes the new key, never printing the value.

## Run it

```bash
node "$VC_SECRETS" migrate
```

On the gpg backend the agent has to be warm first, so run `node "$VC_SECRETS" unlock` in a terminal
before this — `migrate` itself never prompts, it reads with pinentry disabled and fails fast on a cold
agent rather than waiting for a passphrase nobody can type. That works even here, before anything has
been migrated: `unlock` decrypts whichever of the current or the legacy stored file exists, so it warms
the agent equally well before a migration as after one.

If every secret reports as unreadable, check whether the shell can reach your credential store at all
(a sandboxed or restricted shell cannot read `~/.gnupg`, the Keychain or Credential Manager). That
answer is about the shell, not about the stored secrets.

## What it does per secret

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `migrated` | the legacy entry was read and written under the new key |
| `already present` | the new key already resolves — nothing to do |
| `no legacy entry` | nothing to carry over; `set <name>` is the next step |
| `cannot tell whether it is already migrated, refusing to touch it` | the store answered neither "here it is" nor "absent" — a cold gpg agent, a timeout, a wrong recipient. Nothing was written, deliberately: the alternative is overwriting a current value with a stale one. Fix the store (`unlock`, or check the backend) and re-run |
| `migration failed` | the write itself failed; the old entry is untouched |

The run exits non-zero if any secret failed or could not be judged. Idempotent, so re-running is safe —
but do not run it alongside a `set` of the same secret: it decides "already migrated?" and then writes,
so a value stored in between would be overwritten with the older one. The legacy `mcpw:<name>` entry (or `~/.config/mcpw/secrets/<name>.gpg`) is left in place: nothing reads
it, and deleting it would add a second way to fail. Remove it by hand later if you want the store tidy.

## Report

The per-secret lines verbatim plus the final count, then run `/vc-secrets:doctor` and confirm the
migrated names now report `OK`. If any secret says `no legacy entry`, list it explicitly — that is a
value nobody has, and the operator needs to know before a server fails at launch.
