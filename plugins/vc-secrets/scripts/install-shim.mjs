// install-shim.mjs — puts the shim at a stable path and prints the settings entry and the commands
// that use it.
//
// This exists as a script rather than as prose in the command file because the three operations are
// exact: resolve one directory, copy one file, print the entry and the commands. Prose would have the
// agent re-derive them on every run, and a script can be tested.
//
// It never writes settings.json: that belongs to the developer, and a tool that edits it unasked is a
// tool nobody trusts twice. It prints; the human pastes. The commands it prints for `set`/`unlock`/
// `migrate`/`doctor` use the shim's literal path, so nothing needs writing to a shell's own startup
// file either — there is no second file in this story.

// The data directory survives plugin updates; the cache path carries the version and does not, which is
// the whole reason the shim exists. Its location arrives through `--data-dir`, which the plugin's own
// command fills from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`: Claude Code substitutes that placeholder in the command's
// content, with the value belonging to the plugin that owns the file.
//
// The received value is still checked against this plugin's name, and the check is the load-bearing part
// of this block. The command line is a SHELL line: when Claude Code does not substitute the placeholder,
// the shell expands it from the inherited environment instead — and the environment variable of that name
// is exported to hook and MCP/LSP processes and inherited onward, so a script reached through the Bash
// tool sees whichever plugin's context set it. Measured: `…/data/codex-openai-codex`, an absolute path
// that every syntactic check accepts. Substitution and shell expansion are indistinguishable here, so
// arriving as an argument buys nothing on its own; only the name does.
//
// Getting it wrong is silent and its consequence is remote: uninstalling THAT plugin deletes its data
// directory, which would take this plugin's shim with it, long after the developer pasted the path into
// settings.json.
//
// With no usable value the id is computed rather than searched for: `<plugin>@<marketplace>` with
// non-alphanumerics dashed, both names from manifests this repo ships.
