// Decided from the LAST non-empty line, not from anything anywhere in the stream. vc-secrets writes its
// fatal message immediately before exiting, so on a launcher refusal the last word is the
// launcher's; when the server dies, vc-secrets's own exit path writes nothing, so the last word is the
// server's -- UNLESS the launcher printed a benign warning earlier on the run path AND the server then
// died silently at exit code 1, the one code the discriminator below cannot attribute. That residue is
// known and bounded, not handled. Scanning the whole stream instead reintroduces the conflation in
// both directions, and
// both were measured: a "vc-secrets: channel client refused (nonce)" line followed by "Segmentation
// fault" reported a launcher refusal for a launcher whose server had already started, and a SERVER
// line containing "token endpoint" reported "the server binary was never reached" — a claim that

// prefix. Keeping it was not free -- fail() embeds a failed tool's stderr, so an "az" refusal saying
// "not signed in" would have been classified token and answered with "vc-secrets login" when the
