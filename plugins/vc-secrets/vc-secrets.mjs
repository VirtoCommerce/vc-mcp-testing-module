// yours, so the authorization sits on the declaration itself (only the `where` pointer differs by kind). A
// keyvault declaration at ANY scope: the read is paid for by whatever identity `az` is logged in as, which
// the repository does not own — while the vault and the secret name it reads DO come from the repository, so
// the authorization cannot live there either and is keyed by that pair in the user file. A project-scope
// oauth declaration is the same shape: the token is minted against whatever identity the developer signs in
// as, which the repository does not own — while the tenantId and clientId it signs in against DO come from
// the repository, so the authorization is keyed by that pair in the user file too. A project-declared
// `local` secret needs nothing: its key is namespaced to the project (keyFor), so what you `set` cannot
// be read by another project — the namespacing itself is what stands in for authorization. A sign-in is
// not namespaced that way: the token it mints is not confined to one project, so it cannot stand in for
// a per-project grant the way a namespaced keystore entry can.

// null-prototype while canonicalising its keys — the client level under it is still parsed JSON, which is
