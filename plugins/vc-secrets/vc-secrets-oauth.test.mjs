// referent: "a call site that forgets the lock is refused rather than left unserialised"
// (mcpw.test.js) checked a wiring seam that no longer exists once the lock is resolved

// it calls `cmdLogout(arg, cfg)` with no deps object, exactly like the `login` branch. The
// "three writers, one lock name" test near the end of this section replaces both: it proves the
// default actually reaches the real tokenLockFor, driven directly, for all three writers.
//
// cmdLogout gets NO authorization/policy gate. Minting a credential is the privileged act;
